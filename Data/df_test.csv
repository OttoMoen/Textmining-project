It seems perfect and balanced and enjoyable, without random effects ruining the game. I enjoyed a lot the first 30 hours of game, until that point was a ""DEFENITLY RECOMMEND""However, as you progress you will hit one REALLY FRUSTRATING thing about this game. Rare cards are made overpowered, and there is no chance in hell you will get them unless you either open your wallet or spend hundreds of hours farming and being beaten by players who just have those cards.For example, a card that's super rare (and thus wallet warriors have), cost only 4 to invoke and has 5/6 stats AND also disables all flying units you may have, where all the normal cards costing 4 power have usually around 3/3 stats and do nothing.This applies in a lot of cards, where all the ""really freaking awesome cards"" are just available for long time players or wallet warriors, and you will hit that wall and you will quit this game.That said, I have to say that I really enjoyed the first 30 hours for a free game, but this is as far as I go.",0, early access reviewto brief love game hours playing perfect balanced enjoyable random effects ruining game enjoyed lot hours game point defenitly progress hit frustrating thing game rare cards overpowered chance hell open wallet spend hundreds hours farming beaten players cards example card super rare wallet warriors cost invoke stats disables flying units normal cards costing power usually stats applies lot cards freaking awesome cards available long time players wallet warriors hit wall quit game said enjoyed hours free game far

8,10600,10604,Eternal Card Game,"My original review from jan'17, probably launch of the EA was negative. I gave it another try at steam release, and it is a very pleasant surprize. The devs were not sitting on their hands, but created way more mechanics, so the old boredome is left in the past. Also there are different play modes. And a ton of puzzles. The latter alone would be enough for a thumbs up.I have no intention to use the money shop,and not really interested in the competitive part where I doubt p2w is avoidable in this model. At start the game seems to drop plenty of cards at you, so I guess it will take some time till I get bored with the guantlet and forge. Also have to mention that the gfx is top notch and the interface as good as you can ask for.

I always hear people complain about hackers in FPS games but this is the first time I have seen actual scripting. It is uncontrolled and unchecked. The admins do not do anything because the hackers pay actual money to purchase items in game. If you manage to find a well-balanced game without hackers, it can be fun. This happens very very rarely. Please, look at my hours played. I know what I am talking about. If you play in the game, American teams lose 9/10 games. This is not an exaduration.

10,10865,10869,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an amazing card game. Gets rid of everything that bogs down Magic and Hearthstone, and is free to play - bonus! Only issue I have is the obscene cost of gems - the money to amount ratio given the amount of gems you need to do various things is horrendous. For $3.99 I can get 200 gems, which will buy me a pack that I could most likely get for FREE via coins going through gauntlets. I understand it's a free to play, but if people (like me) are willing to spend money on a game you should at least make sure that your bottom amount can obtain something. The card crafting is awesome as well, but again, the cost to create/destroy is a bit out of whack - maybe half the create cost when you destroy a card?I don't know who to contact about this, but I would love to be in on future gameplay design. I've played Magic since 1997 (roughly Ice Age release) and have played in local and state tournaments. I've run gaming groups/clubs at colleges, and been a member of local groups in my town. Have even been researching owning my own card shop/game center. Please contact @ lazaren5632@gmail.com for the above?

17,2125,2128,Path of Exile,"Path of Legends is another great indie game to add to EA's records of acheivement. You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.Eventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.    Rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.THe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch  a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo. In any case, you leave the island and make your way to eden prime, and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on.until next time, stay snazzy gamerz!",1, path legends great indie game add ea records acheivement start selection characters include lulu dark witch taric holy lastly master yi forgoten avanger played yi story great plot holes case find beach summer cruise ship got assaulted deadswamp pirates yi engaged married family onboard cruise time unfortunately pirates ruthless slayed man woman child yi tried resist overpowerd surge lightening stormy night accompanied deadswamp pirate assault wreckage ship eventually floated island start game s lying face planted dirt learn survive craft tools immersion breaks cut trees bare hands suppose attributed yi badass justified eventually build nice hut grindy farming establish good forward outpost promted mid game purchase station cash soney online entertainment website speed things fan dlc nt support ea decision monetise indie games like build foward outpost fight boss giant enemy crab symbolic yi personal struggles japanese heritage crab symbolic real historical battles ancient china little historian found compelling plot twist beating crab allows advance section meet rico cause rico gives grappleing hook cruise ship took bullet hip nt previous game fortunately yi gets swing area pretty quickly hook allows central island plot thickens yi discovers s american military base centred area testing equipment yi appraoches base freindly manner instantly gunned escapes inch life game turns gurrilla warfare fromt point need key military instillations island propaganda stations fuel depots try win local populus ve garnered strength military hq head liberate panaoa terrorist organisation rooted heart island final stages game involve strolling halls hq span deep underground yi uncovers secrets place holds organisation responsible pirate attack ship hired mercinaries trying obtain rare artifact transported cruise knew clearly explaines rico onboard certainly ordinary cruise artifact reanimate flesh create necromongers satisfy weird cult called zoology established tom ultman point yi knew needed space game ends yi having choise destroy evil facility instead render inert future research alliance hope harness power bretheren moons choice hitch ride ebon normandy test vehicle hanger fully developed primed space flight local aquaintances met island solo case leave island way eden prime basis second installment league exiles indieholic ardently await greasy little hands time stay snazzy gamerz

26,2466,2469,War Thunder,"I wish there was a 'maybe' option for recommendation. War Thunder as a functional game has it's quirks, but is just fine and stands alone in what it delivers.However, it's management and documentation appear to have little to no thought put towards them at all. I feel sorry for the developers at Gaijin, because it's obvious they are working their fingers to the bone to add new items and fix multiple standing issues, but the part of the organization responsible for public interface usually boils all that work down to:Client stability has been improved.That is the message you get regardless of how many silent changes are made to major game mechanics, such as the flip-flopping of the (absolutely infuriating) ability to crash your bonus aircraft into ground vehicles in ground force arcade battle mode, and recieve a kill.Major issues;1 - major game functions and operation have gone completely undocumented. To determine how a given mechanic is supposed to work, you can check the warthunder site or wiki; if you don't immediately find an article you may as well give up because the only data you're going to find is speculative/anecdotal on the WT forum or reddit.2 - The game is too matured for new users to truly become established. Players gonna play, and some have been playing for three years straight and are practiced to seemingly superhuman levels of performance. And, as soon as you research a tier II or battle rating 3.0 (unsure which, not well documented), you're going to play these people. Prepare to die, unless you find a squadron to hook up with and guide you along.3 - Weird things happen, and Gaijin really doesn't seem to care. This is perhaps because some of the weirdness isn't so weird... it may be intentional. Gaijin is a Russian company with a largely Russian staff, and I can't fault them for having some national pride. I can fault them deeply for putting/leaving in place a series of metrics for shell penetration at angle, who's curves have curious bends in them (i.e. in the 'more likely to ricochet') right around the values where you'd find the most common angles of post-war Russian tank armor. They seem to take calculated risks in 'balancing' non-Russian vehicles by nerfing some component, but only so much that those playing the vehicles don't rise up in revolt since the game touts it's ""realism"". I have a feeling there are contingents on Gaijin's staff that fight over balancing versus realism, since the game seems to wobble drunkenly between the two states constantly. Bringing balance issues to Gaijin's attention is a fools errand unless you have copies of original texts and about 8 months to burn waiting for someone to actually take up your case, and be prepared to be told no, even in case of well-documented egregious errors in vehicle performance. Why? Because it doesn't fit whatever plan they have, or they simply can't be bothered.4 - near total lack of public communications over anything that's not new and revenue-generating. See ""Client stability has been improved"". If they'd spend a little more time on player stability....5 - massive hubris, everywhere you look. Be it a developer in a video quipping ""Everyone loves killing tankers, right?"", which was said very soon after the reintroduction of ""lawn darting"" play into ground arcade mode, to the moderators on the WT forums who are just doing their job but operate with a set of rules that always seem to end in ""send player to Gulag"", when the real problem with the forums is that players are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at being ignored and uninformed that they're becoming toxic. I know, I are one. Said the sarcasm, got the warning. The biggest current issue under #5 is server performance.. probably. A great number of players report triple-digit pings and packet loss (the game shows you during play, bottom left corner). Packet loss is disastrous for WT because it's a server-side calculation engine; it's impossible to 'hack' most things, but if the server doesn't get your fire command, comrade, then you didn't fire. Except to you, you did. And the tank will register a reload period and loss of 1 shell, which doesn't matter much because you're usually dead by the point you'd notice. Anyhow, great swaths of people complain about this, but because they haven't gone through the exact steps... ignored. Pointing this out will get you banned, comrade. So it seems that the largest response you get from either the staff at Gaijin or the forum moderators is:""We don't believe you."" followed by thread lock. You know what? As I've been correlating issues here I've been getting angrier and angrier. The WT positives: Game looks great, game control is fine, fairly immersive. True free2play.Negatives: you're going to be abused on the playing field, badly. Problem? Gaijin don't give a damn. New functions come online without a lot of consideration for potential problems. Serious lack of PR comms for patches or other issues. General lackadaisical handling of anything that isn't a new mode or model. F2P play can accomplish everything paid play can with little exception (premium vehicles, etc), but expect every little advancement to take days, weeks, or months of crunching along in underperforming vehicles against players and squads that have been zapping newbs like you for half a decade. If you're a bad loser, STAY AWAY.  If you're a good loser... the game may make you a bad loser. If you're a winner, well, prepare to pay up or take so long to get anywhere that you go a little crazy anyways. Hey! You know what? The above review has convinced me to click ""NO"" on recommendation. I will, however, keep crunching along myself, because I'm masochistic like that.

That being said, when women are pretty much rubbing their used panties against your face, I think you have the go ahead.  See, what Sakura clicker does right is that it just kind of gets rid of that fool they force you to learn about in their other products. This time they replaced the self insert male character surrounded by cute girls by making said character a cute girl. The game is a clicker, as it says in the title. What you do is click on ""monsters"" until they're defeated so you can make gold to recruit more heroes to help you fight said monsters. Considering how the monsters react to your attacks I assume that spanking is involved in some way. There really isn't much to say about the game other than this. There's a little bit of customization that you can do to your avatar. I added cat ears and a tail to mine so that says something about me. Sakura Clicker isn't for me. I see the appeal in clicker games, and cute monster girls can really take something like this so far for me. My enjoyment of this game was directly tied to the condition of my doodle. Do you enjoy clickers? Then by all means, go nuts. Do you enjoy cute girls with cat ears? Well this will keep your attention for a little bit longer. Other than that, play about 30 minutes, write a fan fiction about the events, make a mess of your keyboard, have yourself a good ol time.

29,2553,2556,War Thunder,"If you love outstanding physics, intense tank battles, realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay....Then you came to the wrong game. Welcome to War Thunder, please insert money to continue. For some reason the developers seem to think Russia and Germany won WWII as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen. I've done my best to enjoy this game, but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing, it's somewhat impossible to do so. I've seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble 12 year old Xbox Live children angry they can't get a kill, however don't take this review as such. The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.But if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!But the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map. HOWEVER! ""If you do pay for premium,"" your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.So grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game).

30,7032,7036,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"Second Review after bout 500 hours.My first Review was positive. Its still a good CCG. No paywall, no p2w. Good mecanics. Play for free for a long time.Good learning curve. Good ingame rewards for successful playing and free card / gold drops by connecting account to twitch.But...In the long run it lacks a good meta for multiplayer. You have ranked play that reset every month. So you have to climb the ladder again and again and thats not a competition, it feels like a senseless grind.Those weekend events just give you more ""ingame"" but after playing for a long time you got enough cards.What leads to a bad overall result is a broken core mechanic all CCGs suffer. And thats randomness and luck factor, the developers decided to boost this more and more instead to reduce it.After a while you realize you win by luck and lose by bad luck. This become so frustrating cause its not rewarding in any matter. you dont feel good win by luck, but you feel bad by losing by opponents luck/your bad luck.I also expect there is some kind of cheat/hack around that manipulate the  randomness of own/opponent card draw. Its hard to have evidence bout this, cause it can all be luck or bad luck. But i cant belive some people are constantly more lucky than others.Its my opinion, and it poisened the rest of the fun i had playing combos of cards in casual mode and rarely get those going in ranked mode. Generally this free to play game suffers same issue all free to play games suffer in the long run:Everyone can create as many accounts as he wish, so a ban of trolls and grief players is impossible.Despite its  a multiplayer game, there is no teamplay possible. There is a social UI where you can even spectate your friends games, but it dont make any sense, cause everyone plays on his own versus others who play on their own.So for what you will play this? Till you have your stack of cards that make you win some games in multiplayer its a salty way. After you have a competitive deck, you need competition. There is no competition in a game where luck always defeat skill and expirience.I regret now i spendet some money and so much time on this game. It was a waste of time and looking back i was more angry/frustrated playing this game than happy and joyful. The greed of getting/crafting better cards and the hope of getting ""better by time and expirience"" held me captive so long. By creating an illusion this game is very succsessful.Be aware, compared to other multiplayer games that reward you at least with some nice memories or new friends this leaves you with nothing but a black hole. This must be like, if you awake from a drug consume.Lesson learned, keep your hands of CCGs and free to play multiplayer games with a big russian community.Deinstalled.Best regards ",0, second review bout hours review positive good ccg paywall good mecanics play free long time good learning curve good ingame rewards successful playing free card gold drops connecting account twitch long run lacks good meta multiplayer ranked play reset month climb ladder s competition feels like senseless grind weekend events ingame playing long time got cards leads bad overall result broken core mechanic ccgs suffer s randomness luck factor developers decided boost instead reduce realize win luck lose bad luck frustrating cause rewarding matter nt feel good win luck feel bad losing opponents luck bad luck expect kind cheat hack manipulate randomness opponent card draw hard evidence bout cause luck bad luck nt belive people constantly lucky opinion poisened rest fun playing combos cards casual mode rarely going ranked mode generally free play game suffers issue free play games suffer long run create accounts wish ban trolls grief players impossible despite multiplayer game teamplay possible social ui spectate friends games nt sense cause plays versus play play till stack cards win games multiplayer salty way competitive deck need competition competition game luck defeat skill expirience regret spendet money time game waste time looking angry frustrated playing game happy joyful greed getting crafting better cards hope getting better time expirience held captive long creating illusion game succsessful aware compared multiplayer games reward nice memories new friends leaves black hole like awake drug consume lesson learned hands ccgs free play multiplayer games big russian community deinstalled best regards

34,10837,10841,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThis is a digital card game with the depth of Magic and the polish of Hearthstone. Direwolf has hired on some of Magic's best pros to help out with the card design and it really shows.This game uses MTG attacking and blocking, meaning it is easier to get a stalled board than Hearthstone, but so far I've not had too many issues with it because there are lots of way to break stalls with combat tricks and other cards. You can play instants in this game, though they are called Fast Spells, and can only be played in response to a card being used on your units, during combat, and at the end of turn. This is actually very nice because it means you aren't f2ing through your opponent's turn. There are a few RNG cards, though nothing nearly obscene as in Hearthstone.This game has you put your mana, which is called power in this game, in your deck, like in Magic. However colors are done through Influence. Once you get 1 of an influence of color, you can play any card that only has that influence requirement. So you don't have to worry about using the right color power. For players coming from Hearthstone, the power system can be a sore point because you will come across times where you either draw too much power, or not enough power. You get a free Mulligan each game. When you take a Mulligan, you are stuck with what hand you draw. However after you mulligan, you are guaranteed to get at least two power in your hand. The free-to-play model is very generous. It follows the same pattern of Hearthstone, but since each pack contains 12 cards, rather than 5, it makes it easier to get all the common and uncommon cards. Also, drafting and forge let you keep the cards you choose, which let you build up your collection that way.All-in-all, I would say this is an excellent game and highly recommend that anyone try it.",1, early access reviewthis digital card game depth magic polish hearthstone direwolf hired magic best pros help card design shows game uses mtg attacking blocking meaning easier stalled board hearthstone far issues lots way break stalls combat tricks cards play instants game called fast spells played response card units combat end turn actually nice means opponent turn rng cards nearly obscene hearthstone game mana called power game deck like magic colors influence influence color play card influence requirement worry right color power players coming hearthstone power system sore point come times draw power power free mulligan game mulligan stuck hand draw mulligan guaranteed power hand free play model generous follows pattern hearthstone pack contains cards makes easier common uncommon cards drafting forge let cards choose let build collection way excellent game highly recommend try

This game used to be playable as a Free 2 Play player, but Konami has reduced the number of gems (in game currency used to buy packs) over and over, and keep adding new boxes every two weeks... So to keep up with the meta you either have to play the game about 5-6 + hours a day at LEAST, or spend a lot of money.. Powerful cards and archtypes are added with each box making it necessary to invest in these boxes for certain cards, and since the number of gems has been reduced to less than half.....

43,14345,14350,Shop Heroes,"Look, for a browser like game, I've never seen a game like this, at least in term of business managament and comerce.This game allows you to open your own store, hire your own workers and make items and equipments to sell to the adventurers that shows up, alongside that, you unlock new recipes of weapons of either the same type, or different type, or even reducing the crafting material count of the item, aswell as increase the chances of crafting a higher grade item.The better the item, the higher the price, but you also have social skills to use in the trade, at the cost of some hearts, you can offer a discount to gain hearts, at the cost of a less pricy item, overcharge the the item to gain more lucre at the cost of hearts, or even give a chat to the buyer to have the chance of gaining or losing hearts.There is also a second fact, if the equipment you sell to the adventurer is better than the one the adventurer is wearing, the adventurer will equip it, but nothing stops you from crafting the item yourself and giving to the adventurers, so they have some gear.Later in the game, you may even end up receiving adventurers at your shop offering you goods they found in some undisclosed location, you can bargain for lower prices before buying, or refusing to buy the item.The game also features a Mission system, which in the inn,  you can send your costumers to raid a (timed) dungeon, which after the timer runs out, you can check the result of the dungeon raid, I just don't recommend you to send your costumers to their private quests, I did those 3 times and those quests ended up failing, making the costumers unable to do missions for around 4 hours, which is a complete .Beside the most impressive fact in this game is how the Town system works, if you create or join a town, you and the other citizens can invest on the structures to unlock new characters, new workers, or even to increase the number of resource gathering per hour.The only con about the town system, is that if a citizen leaves the town, all the gold it have invested on the town structures will be gone, so you may end up even losing a character that were unlocked in the town due to that.And to finish the good part of the game, sometimes a npc surges at your shop, requesting a large number of items, when you complete that npc requests, you gain a good reward. I even had to use the market in the game to buy some of the necessary items from other players, and the good part is that they did a good price for me, so I were able to complete the npc requests.Yes, this game have a market system, you can sell the things you do for a nice price, and then later check out for lucre, or you can look on the market for a item you are looking for and then buy it for the best price as possible.Now, the annoying part of the game, is that having the npcs entering and leaving your town several times can end up being boring, since it's a chore to craft and sell the items to the npc, but you can try to offer them some more expensive items disponible in the shop instead, if you have the hearts for that, and try to overprice for a nice lucre.There is a limit for almost everything in the game, like furnitures placed, workers hired, how many items you can craft at the same time, and even workers you can have.You can buy the expansion for the coins you make selling items for npcs and players, or by using gems that are the game cash item, but if you don't meet the level requirement for the upgrade, the price will be insane (like, you make around 5k coins with some sales, the price of the upgrade is 300k because you have not the level for it), and sometimes you will feel like needing the upgrade, but will be unable to buy it because of the insane price, that unless you spend for it.The arena is the worst part of the game, you first join the arena to be shamefully beaten, you may end up finding a enemy player with characters of ten times more might than your characters, which is very absurd and primitive, the game should try to find challenge based on around the player might, so the battle have some chance of winning, and the tutorial arena fight you can't even refuse, so you are forced to lose miserably.Almost customization items in the game are only by gems, while a few coin customization and upgrades are unlocked by levels, generally, only 1 furniture or customization is unlocked per level.So, there is my review, the game is not really that bad, but at the first day, you may end up addicted so...Don't forget to eat something, like someone here.

54,3678,3681,Team Fortress 2,"Life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters. Hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields springing up and appealing you into some fresh conflict, and only a few surely understood redirections make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release. What's more, a short time later there's Team Fortress 2. Released in 2007, this class-based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year, in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering. Since GameSpot's one of a kind TF2 review, the entertainment has benefitted from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to-play plan of activity. The middle action pits two gatherings of players against each other in a battle to get centers, move a truck, or take an organizer case. The objective is always uncommonly clear; it's the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The convenient scout, the assailant generous, the tireless pro, the conspiring specialist, the irritating sharpshooter, the tricky see, the feisty pyro, the shaky trooper, and the fundamentally more-risky demoman all have exceptional weapons, attributes, and limits that supplement each other and strife in bundle ways. Encounters can vary comprehensively depending upon the match sort and the beautifiers of each gathering, and this strangeness is dire to TF2's long-standing solicitation. When you leave the door as a mind-boggling with a specialist near to, you're a forcing unfriendly constrain, yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come unwound in a matter of seconds. Master marksmen can cover expected foe ways, however rocket-ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding elective courses and raining dangerous going from above. You may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights, just to be lurched by a baseball and beat the life out of. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit packaging of your cheerful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end. Besides, engaging jokes, insane outfits, and sensational host build up this sprightly tone. Clearly, this inside component has endured for by far most of TF2's future, so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches, you'll find things are to a great degree surely understood. Taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information, and acing pushed frameworks doesn't just make you deadlier; it gives you more options for how to approach fight. Keeping your choices open is still gainful too, in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a disastrously imbalanced squad. It is Team Fortress, taking all things into account. Regardless, however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection, there have been some noticeable changes consistently, and moreover ordinary imbuements of new weapons and things. Of the few things available in the online store, some can be opened through play, while others must be acquired with genuine money. From little knickknacks that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds, there's a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience. Some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainment's starting now saucy toon snappy. You can buy tops, shirts, shoes, and other remedial gear to spruce up like a character from Adult Swim or wear spooky incidental garments that you can wear just in the midst of Halloween or a full moon. Notwithstanding the likelihood that you don't support spending for any of this stuff, it's diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire. The best difference from the redirection's beginnings comes in the accommodating mode, Mann versus Machine. In it, you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of robotized incarnations of TF2's classes from passing on a bomb to your base. The money you pick up from pulverizing robots can be spent on mid-organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry, which can be essential to accomplishment. For sure, even on the most easy level, the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering. This is a mode where absolutely masterminded weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the differentiation among succeeding and attempting, endeavor afresh. You can play this mode to no end, yet you won't be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a Tour of Duty ticket. Notwithstanding the way that it doesn't have the energized oddity of centered play, the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through. However, contention is the honest to goodness draw, and the Team Fortress 2 gathering can completely be engaged. On a couple of servers, you might be scolded for unwitting cracks of respectability, while on others, you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and ubercharges. You can even demand help on particular servers and be corresponded with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk. The society around TF2 is a charming one, not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight, yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons, things, and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience. It feels like a gathering of managers, without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier. Staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter, yet, here's Team Fortress 2, still overflowing after seven years in the business. Every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then, and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class-based shooter competition the way TF2 does. The experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless, so however your permitted to-play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years, there are few that do it furthermore Team Fortress 2.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

I noticed also in some training missions, mapped controls don't line up with the directions. I've been able to work around it all.

63,10986,10990,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewTLDR: One of the best card games out there. Not recommended due to flawed (apparently unfixable) core mana/power mechanic.Comparisons to MtG and Hearthstone barely do it justice. While it drew inspiration from the two, the varied mechanics make every faction/color fight on equal footing. From aggro to midrange, or even late game mammoth decks, they all clash for a piece of the pie.Well, the same is valid for every card game! What makes this one special?The sheer feel of power your cards give. Compared to any other CCG, the strength of these cards is absurd. The feed-back you get from your deck (when you win) is that you stomped the opponent, even if the game was close. While losing has the reverse effect, the game doesn't let you dwell on the past. Rewards are given with every occasion: single player campaigns, AI games, first win of the day, and so on. You’ll have to keep your aspirations to a top tier place in check tough. Getting a decent collection still requires investment (time and/or money), as in every CCG.Other players have said more positives about the game than I could write in a limited space.As such, I will focus on why I gave it a negative mark.Like MtG, it suffers from power fixing issues: you either get too much or too little (mana/power flood or screw). They mended the algorithm several times, and yet, it is far from working. I won’t quote other players or streamers; suffice to say the issue is real. The amount of games lost due to mana/power issues is enough to make the grind tiring and unpleasant. As strange as it sounds, it’s even sadder when the opponent has it. Adding these losses up, you end up with a simple question: why isn’t there anything being done? Well, there is. Maybe. The communications regarding the issue is minimal. For me, the bigger question is why they chose the classical (MtG) style of mana/power fixing knowing the flaw it has. More so considering some of the main developers are former MtG players.The game is beautiful: fun mechanics, captivating games, great feed-back and rewards. But all of it is diminished to a zero line by its flawed core mechanic: mana/power fixing. A flaw I don’t believe will ever be fixed.Prove me wrong.",0, early access reviewtldr best card games recommended flawed apparently unfixable core mana power mechanic comparisons mtg hearthstone barely justice drew inspiration varied mechanics faction color fight equal footing aggro midrange late game mammoth decks clash piece pie valid card game makes sheer feel power cards compared ccg strength cards absurd feed deck win stomped opponent game close losing reverse effect game let dwell past rewards given occasion single player campaigns ai games win day aspirations tier place check tough getting decent collection requires investment time money players said positives game write limited space focus gave negative mark like mtg suffers power fixing issues little mana power flood screw mended algorithm times far working wo quote players streamers suffice issue real games lost mana power issues grind tiring unpleasant strange sounds sadder opponent adding losses end simple question maybe communications issue minimal bigger question chose classical mtg style mana power fixing knowing flaw considering main developers mtg players game beautiful fun mechanics captivating games great feed rewards diminished zero line flawed core mechanic mana power fixing flaw believe fixed prove wrong

71,13309,13313,Creativerse,"A fun sandbox/voxel game a la minecraft-esque.I would not recommend upgrading to the pro version as it is not worth the money. The devs have spoken on adding more to the pro version but you essentially get a worthless light that doesn't really illuminate anything and can follow you around and you also get a glider. The glider is VERY wonky and seems out of place in the game. I would have preferred a jet pack as I think that at least would help when building higher structures. You get the ability to mess with your world options in the pro version and can increase the treasure drop rate or mess with low-gravity to name a few.The game feels sort of like it is in early access. There is not a ton of monster variety and there is a small pool of craftable items. I do have to dock some points also for putting crafting materials behind a paywall. If you want a steampunk home, the only way to get those blocks is with real money and that is not the route the devs should be going down.What this game does well is blueprints. If you are like me and lack imagination for a structure. Purchase a blueprint (with either real money or crafting materials you find in game) and then find the materials and fill in the blocks (think, paint-by-numbers) to then create and complete the blueprint into a functioning dwelling! You can also pay to receive all the materials for that blueprint instead of finding/crafting them yourself. With the latest update, they have added Steam workshop functionality for blueprints so I am excited to see what users can create and share.Overall, this is a free game at its core and it does a pretty good job of getting off the ground. Hopefully, the pro purchasers get more for their money and more content/enemies/crafting gets added (pets fighting with you!) and they remove the paywall of certain materials being real money only. I would be OK with them moving that content to the pro version and then you can still craft the materials or if you want to shell out money and have them given to you then be my guest. Pro should give you access to the entire game. Period. They should only be asking for more money to remove the hindrance/time it takes to gather the materials.TL;DR Free, fun game.

But I was just get continuosly killed as soon as entering the brawl. While I'm surely not a killer machine, in other similar games I at least am able to kill other players here the feeling was that my relatively high ping (250 to 500) was punishing me very unfairly. The developer said ping shouldn't be such an issue but I can't find another explanation. Note I even tried the one day premium account to see if the problem was there, but not luck even here. Another very disappointing thing about this game it is way too expensive if you try to accellarate your way to more advanced skills and weapons.

Second, Enemies seem to be quite strong early on. Artix, if you read this, then maybe lower enemy stats a bit, especially low level ones when you start out.Third, the XP system. It takes way too long to level up! Especially been a new player. Either fix amount of XP gained when defeating enemies or lowering the XP count to a new level when you're a new player.Fourth, Gameplay is quite easy to pick up straightaway. Just like any MMO game.Fifth, the first game to be cross-platformed between PC and Android/Apple. If I'm out anywhere and want to play, I just log in on the app on my phone and BAM! Sixth, when logging back in, it takes you back to last location, which is pretty cool and saves time remebering what you were doing or where you were.Overall, I'd probably say 7/10. If Artix just fixes those little problems I mentioned and I'm sure as anyone else has, then I'll happily give it 10/10EDIT SECTION:Another thing I found highly annoying, is enemies automatically attack you when you run past them, causing you to stop what you are doing and deal with them",1, early access reviewfirst like enjoyed artix games child game join list second enemies strong early artix read maybe lower enemy stats bit especially low level ones start xp system takes way long level especially new player fix xp gained defeating enemies lowering xp count new level new player fourth gameplay easy pick straightaway like mmo game fifth game cross platformed pc android apple want play log app phone bam sixth logging takes location pretty cool saves time remebering overall probably artix fixes little problems mentioned sure happily section thing found highly annoying enemies automatically attack run past causing stop deal

You're definitely not going to get max mastery without P2W, but there are also other ways of having fun in the game.  And besides, who needs 300 party animals anywaysXD.There are 16 classes right now, and a bunch of them are ones I use regularly.  I use neon ninja to farm adventurre worlds, and gunslinger to farm sts and speed run mainly.  Then, if needed I can use Ice Sage to tank dreadnaught, and if needed I can use rev to tank pinata god.  The best class to start out with it either boomer or lunar lancer or candy barb, and then when you get to 5k pr and have a class gem key switch everything over to shadow hunter and wreck every adventure world.

84,6240,6244,Heroes & Generals,"PHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW I have waited a long time to write this review.  Heroes and Generals is the best made game I have ever played, but... the most poorley made game I have ever played.  You start up the game, pick a faction: Russia     (The one everybody loves), Germany, (The one everybody hates), and the Allies (The other one). When you first start playing, it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing, and you generally have a good time.  Then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like, with smgs, semi auto rifles, bolt action rifles and good stuff like that.  Also, you die super fast, and don't expect to have health regen.  If you get hurt, the game will not help you out, so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently (or inconveniently) around the map.  Same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or anti-tank weapons.  But you will die (Trust me, you will) and you will spawn back in... AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP HAHAHAHAHA!  Yes, you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die.  I suggest that you invest in your faction's truck early on.  Speaking of vehicles, the gameplay with them is crazy, fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics.  But they have one other type of vehicle... Tanks.  Oh dear lord TANKS!  Where do I even begin... Okay.  I can do this.  You will have PTSD after playing for the first time with tanks.  They are OP as balls and make you die and respawn, but we already covered that.  If you don't take the game seriousley, as I often just mess around, they can add some fun to the game, but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it.  Oh, and planes are the same thing, except you can't destroy them NEARLEY as easily as you can with tanks.  Then I bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game.Now, I will tank I mean TALK about the largest issue with the game.  The Grind.  After the first set of vehicles and weapons, tier II weapons all cost way too much.  You can't make the money that you need because of another system I will talk about later.  Because of the low amount of maps to play on, there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons.  You can't even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you don't have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it.  I will give you an example.  Say I am playing as the Allies.  I want the Thompson SMG, a Ka Bar knife and some stick grenades.  I have the M1 Garand, and I level up my infantry assault ribon to level 4 to get the Grease Gun SMG and some Pinaple Grenades.  Now I buy a shovel, because I need to get to level 5 in close combat to unlock the knife.  I use the SMG, but then i'm not using the grenades, so I can't level up in explosives.  I switch to grenades, but then i'm not using my shovel so i'm not leveling up close combat.  I use my shovel, but then i'm not using my SMG.  I pick up the smg that the enemy I just killed dropped and use that.  But then i'm not getting xp in my Grease Gun so i can upgrade it.  So it goes in a terrible circle.I do like one system in the game, beleive it or not: The weapon upgrade system.  If you use a weapon of your faction a lot, you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it, like springs, sights, barrels and some cosmetic things like skins.  I like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most.  For instance, I like the M1 Garand.  A lot.  I first used it as a sniper weapon, changing the ammo, getting better gas sealing and even a scope.  But then I changed it to a close-quarters weapon, taking off the scope, lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire.  There is a downside to this system, however.The game's repair system, Ho MAMA.  Every bullet you fire, every vehicle you spawn, every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag.  It costs money, lots of it.  I kind of like the system, as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary, but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own.  Also, you guessed it- upgrades cost money between matches, so the game also punishes you for using them, which is a little strange.Here are my suggestions to make this game better.1. Add more weapons, so skill trees don't only unlock you one or two weapons2. Lower the prices on everything, the game grinds on for way to long3. Add more maps, the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools, playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast.4.Balance your damn tanks5.Place spawn points much closer to the action.Okay... My opinion of this game... I like this game and want it to be good, but it is constantley held back from all these problems.  And I know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff, but that is NO excuse for what we have NOW.  They should have waited much longer on releasing this game, as I am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks.  But one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play, as of now.  My final rating for Heroes and Generals is a 7/10.I will continue to update this review as the game progresses.

86,10794,10798,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewPros:+ The few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ Constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ Mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ Similar to Magic the GatheringCons:- Most games go into top deck mode- Mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- Legendaries are very expensive- Stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)Here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed:https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame/comments/64ktxt/lets_talk_eternal_im_dwd_game_designer_patrick/dg4qiam/I think this is very misguided. CCGs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. Variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. Take League of Legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. As far as I am concerned, every match where I'm mana screwed is the same. I have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.Since the playerbase is comprised of mostly Magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. Also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.Another praise I often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why I became interested in the first place. Again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.Verdict:Overall, Eternal is a near exact copy of Magic. To me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. However, I cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from Magic.",0, early access forth matches happen time time actually incredibly complex constant stream packs generous mana system allows wide variety similar magic games deck mana screw flood absolutely legendaries stubborn playerbase official developer stance getting mana screwed r eternalcardgame think misguided ccgs fun serial gambler wants coin flip away variance fun allows match different different decisions league legends example variance depth come champions picks counter changing playstyle far concerned match mana screwed decision watching slideshow opponent interacting face playerbase comprised magic players anybody satisfied mana system usually discredited directed play chess instead insulting deck building element fun strong argument system simply available late new players diverse collection takes long time build praise heard game complexity decision making interested place holds true deck building match deck mode pretty game decided person gets mana flooded verdict overall eternal near exact copy magic good thing base gameplay fun unique recommend game result infuriating gaming experiences face developer stance issue means situation resolved game significantly differentiate magic
87,15717,15722,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewAfter giving this game a pretty serious bit of time over the last month I have to sadly give it a thumbs down as a PC game. Now as for on mobile devices Id say its standard play with a solid art style. But for those of us on PCs here on steam  as maybe a pure ftp game its an ok casual time waster.However the game is thick with micro transactions. It costs to skip many hour long( sometimes day long) crafting times.It costs for many cosmetic rewards you still have to first earn the right to use via game play. Now the company wanting money is not some sin. But consider this. for the ultimate guardian pack they want 50 bucks. You get a few unique cosmetics, some extra storage a butt load of their dragon crystal points that still wont get you more then a few of the pricier point only in game items.Now consider a classic but high quality pay once play forever fully finished MMO like Guild Wars. for 30 bucks you get the classic campaign trilolgy and for another 20 the eye of the north expansion. While old GW is far from dated. the graphics are still eye catchingly lovely, and easily destroy the cartoon style of this game. Game play wise, sure GW does especially during its lowbie levels use  common collect and fetch quest systems, but also has rich virbant stories, and many quests that demand the use of ones brain or at least reading the comprehensive wiki to develop winning strategies.While I can see dabbling in this game from time to time, and using it as a chat room game, the moment I start thinking of spending a cent it loses out to many other games. Many of which I can get many hours of play in for a much more modest price.Sadly this company seems more about drawing in a fan base that they can sell silly RL merchendise like shirts, novelty hats, and primitive physical calenders all with in game cosmetic items as part of the deal, to make their money. It feels like they are wasting alot of their development energy on limited time events, exclusive cosmetics that require buying some item that will act as free advertisment for them, and very little really spent on content or QoL improvments.So while if I could Id rate it as an ok entry into mobile games, for steam pc gamers we just have too many better options to waste time or risk money on an EAG that shows little real potential to rival even old pc MMO like classic Guild Wars.Soif your looking for a pure FTP with no intent to spend then sure give it some time waster hours, otherwise invest your time and especially your money in something worthy of it.",0, early access reviewafter giving game pretty bit time month sadly thumbs pc game mobile devices d standard play solid art style pcs steam maybe pure ftp game ok casual time waster game thick micro transactions costs skip hour long day long crafting times costs cosmetic rewards earn right use game play company wanting money sin consider ultimate guardian pack want bucks unique cosmetics extra storage butt load dragon crystal points wo nt pricier point game items consider classic high quality pay play forever fully finished mmo like guild wars bucks classic campaign trilolgy eye north expansion old gw far dated graphics eye catchingly lovely easily destroy cartoon style game game play wise sure gw especially lowbie levels use common collect fetch quest systems rich virbant stories quests demand use ones brain reading comprehensive wiki develop winning strategies dabbling game time time chat room game moment start thinking spending cent loses games hours play modest price sadly company drawing fan base sell silly rl merchendise like shirts novelty hats primitive physical calenders game cosmetic items deal money feels like wasting alot development energy limited time events exclusive cosmetics require buying item act free advertisment little spent content qol improvments d rate ok entry mobile games steam pc gamers better options waste time risk money eag shows little real potential rival old pc mmo like classic guild wars soif looking pure ftp intent spend sure time waster hours invest time especially money worthy

104,16352,16357,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"I can't really decide to recommend or dislike. Wish there was a middle option.So yeah. You can go and take apart guns, put them together, and watch how they fire. Pretty cool stuff actually. You start of with an AK-47, then unlock the M1911 (I think, haven't played in a while), then the MP5, and then you get a branching path that you can choose from. Each gun costs XP to buy, and when you complete stages like taking apart the gun, putting the gun together, firing the gun, using the gun at a shooting range, speed-disassembling/assembling the gun, etc. you get XP.However, XP isn't HARD to get, it's just...ANNOYING.The problem with this is that you get WAY to little XP to unlock anything before you become bored. I don't think I made it anywhere past 4 guns (AK47, M1911, MP5, Beretta). To get required XP, you will need to constantly go back and play all of these games OVER and OVER again. It gets boring, trust me.I GUESS it would be good to buy the DLC for this, but honestly, just trust me, using it for something like this might not be the best idea.Is it a bad game? Well, sort of. They tried to make it a game, but I feel like just making it an interactive thing would have been much better and I would have given it a higher score. It's really interesting how you can do this stuff, and the guns are great, but since it's so annoying to get the XP needed to unlock the guns, you probably won't get to a lot of them. If they just lowered the XP required or dropped the ""free to play"", put a cheap price tag on it, and then unlocked all of the guns, that would be better. It IS great for gun enthusiasts, though, and I guess it wouldn't hurt to try it because it is free.",0, decide recommend dislike wish middle option yeah apart guns watch fire pretty cool stuff actually start unlock think played branching path choose gun costs xp buy complete stages like taking apart gun putting gun firing gun gun shooting range speed disassembling assembling gun etc xp hard problem way little xp unlock bored think past guns beretta required xp need constantly play games gets boring trust guess good buy dlc honestly trust like best idea bad game sort tried game feel like making interactive thing better given higher score interesting stuff guns great annoying xp needed unlock guns probably wo lot lowered xp required dropped free play cheap price tag unlocked guns better great gun enthusiasts guess hurt try free

106,1335,1338,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI clicked Yes to recommend because for Early Access, it's pretty good.  The concept is really cool, it's beautiful and the physics are nice.  Unfortunately, I'm (yet again) participating in PvP where everyone on the other team ALWAYS has better ships, better gear in those ships, hits harder and flies faster.  It's frustrating to say the least, not knowing how much of that is on me and my team or on the matching system.  I hope they do somethign to force a bit of balance, maybe only allow X number of Flagships, Y number of Corvettes etc.  Right now, I run into 2 Enforcers, 2 Assassins and maybe a Frigate.  I've only been playing for about 5 days...how do I ever compete with that?  I think if the Devs based the matching on the level of the player (in the ship type he chose before going in) and limited the types of ships per session, it would be more like a Fleet and less like a gathering of like-minded people.  All in all, I like it and will try to keep playing.And yes, I recommended it to a friend of mine despite the above comments.  For Early Access, it's a damned good game compared to, say Race to Mars or Maia.

108,11782,11786,Bless Online,"Early Access Review EDIT: Don't buy it. You know, I ended up finally letting common sense kick in for a little. I really wanted to like this game, and I really wanted to be a part of it and the community, but then I just added up all the development mistakes that have happened in the past few months during the port, with the fact that it's a game that's failed in other regions not only due to its awkward combat, but the base game itself. Yes, it's listed as an alpha game, but every other port of this type (BDO, Archeage, etc) started out as an almost fully working game, with some bugs, or misstranslations here and there. Bless started out with tooltips that make almost no sense, and bugs so severe that areas reload as you're in them, over and over and over again. I tried to push myself to play on a Berzerker (the only class with a working action camera), and I was just flooded with bugs and grindyness that it wasn't worth pushing though it. I  wanted  to love Bless. But in reality, if a game is coming to a new region, with their primary feature being a revamped and fun combat (that's not even fully implemented in the 5 classes they claimed to have adapted it to) it's just a bunch of fluff to a broken game. Maybe they'll work on it down the road, fix their laggy UI, actually implement the action camera, add a dodge mechanic to most classes that interupts animations (you'll find yourself animation locked in telegraphs a LOT), hire someone to translate their UI instead of using an auto translator (You've obtained 2level! 10% damage increase taken reduction!). If you REALLY want to try it, go ahead. Maybe you can push past all the bugs and stay on it long enough for the developers to ""fix"" it. But they'll probably just look for a new region to port it to, I hear Oceania is the new hotspot for thrice failed launches. ----------------- Original Review ----------------- The game is actually pretty fun. Surprisingly fun considering how skeptical I was from the previous releases and how shady the development was.  (There’s a TLDR in the end) That being said, there are so many issues with it right now that I can’t really recommend it. So, I’m going to start out with the bad, and lead into the good. I haven’t played it for long (only had the chance to make two characters and get them past the tutorial) but there is a lot that can be said in terms of issues from there. Here’s what I’ve picked up so far: Breakdown  Graphics 3/5  - The game looks okay. It’s not great, and it’s not horrible. It’s basically a more realistic GW2 artstyle. The skills do look very neat, and the effects are enjoyable. The transition animations are horrible. If you’re walking in a straight line and turn left or right, your character snaps in whatever the direction you’re moving without any transitioning animations. Same for most skills, sometimes it looks like your spine is breaking in half to switch to whatever animation you’re transitioning into. It’s a bit awkward to look at, for me at least.Audio 4/5  – The soundtrack is nice, but the skill and weapon effects are amazing. You actually feel like you’re smacking down with your battle axe thing when you charge it up. It has a nice feeling to it combat wise. The voice acting is pretty bad, and you can’t tell if the voice actors didn’t care, or if they used Microsoft Sam for some of the voices. But the combat sound effects were so enjoyable that I only bumped a point off for the weird dialogue audio. Gameplay 2/5 or 4/5  – I’m having to give combat two scores, because it’s not fully implemented. If you’re playing a Berserker and you’re using the action camera, along with the combos, it’s really enjoyable. It doesn’t have the same excitement as BDO does, but it’s pretty good in it’s own way. It’s some weird hybrid that gives you a sense of flow, and lets you play around with the combos to figure out how to adjust your abilities to each situation. So 4/5 if you’re playing on the Berserker. For every other class, it’s a 2/5, because you’re stuck with a clunky tab targeting system and awkward movement animations that don’t look right. They’ve -disabled- the action camera system for every other class, without even warning the players. They’re supposed to bring them back at some point, but that’s just stuff I’ve head from other players. Story ?/5  – I can’t really judge the story yet, since I’ve only tickled it’s fancy. It seems like it has a lot of potential, if it wasn’t ruined by the awkward voice acting. The developers did make use of the generic evil villain with a robe and facemask, but I enjoy that type, so hopefully they’ll sort out the translations and voice acting soon. Pay2Win (No?)  – Doesn’t seem like it is, the cash shop gives you minor boosters, but nothing that makes you mega overpowered. It’s basically pay-to-level-a-little-faster. Costumes offer no bonuses, nor do they make you almost invisible to other players. (cough, cough, BDO Ghillie Suit, cough) Summary: It has the potential to be a really good game, I’m a huge mmo fanboy and love to play new games in the genre. Graphics are okay, and the sound effects are nice, combat and gameplay is pretty fun (on the ONE class it’s actually implemented in). If all of the classes had the action camera implemented, and the developers were more transparent about missing MAIN FEATURES, I’d definitely recommend Bless Online. But, at least for now, I’d say hold on to your wallets until the developers give us a proper announcement about what’s missing, why it’s missing, and when they plan on giving it to us. I understand that they’re still working on the Mystic/Assassin, and that’s fine, but it also looks like they’re working on four other classes and forgot to tell us.  Note:  You have to edit an .ini file to remove the profanity filter, and your characters don’t have nipples. They used to, but now they magically lost them during some weird censorship that happened. Not a deal breaker to me, but the game was made T rating friendly. TLDR:  I really want to recommend this game, but until there’s some proper communication from the developers about  BASE FEATURES  that were shown in trailers and promised to us (I’m looking at you, gameplay video of a ranger “aiming” to shoot her arrows) I can't do that.  Buy it at your own risk.  This review was done with consideration if this being an early access game. The main complaints are about things that were supposed to be in the base early access game, and that were removed without any major dev announcement, in some cases without any at all.

And this is Early Access.-The HUD sucks given that it's practically meant to be a mobile game.-Turning is slow, with clunky controls/movement. And there's no options to do much about it.And the list goes on. But, as someone who played the hell out of Adventure Quest and Adventure Quest Worlds, I really enjoy it and plan to play more eventually. Artix supported their browser-based flash games for the longest time, and they never did much disappointing.

120,10493,10497,theHunter Classic,"DO NOT READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. PLEASE READ THIS FIRST. This is a very good hunting game. As a real life hunter, I enjoy the level of realism this game provides. It's not realistic in many ways, but it's not a hunting sim (even though I wish it was). That being said, it's certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market. It has a wide variety of environments, weapons, species, and equipment. It has incredible graphics, good AI, awesome online multiplayer, real-time competitions, interesting missions, decent skill system with acheivements, a photo gallery of your kills, and decent statistics tracking. The gameplay is fun while remaining somewhat realistic, but it does have a learning curve. Once you understand how the game works, you'll have a blast. The negative reviews almost all come from people who did not read what they were downloading. They thought this was a completely free game without doing any research into it. theHunter DOES have a subscription based system and microtransactions, but it's not all bad. They just updated their F2P model and it is more than fair now. Keep reading.As I write this review, currently there are 10 maps, 29 huntable species, and one species of dog you can bring hunting with you. When you download the game for free as a guest you are able to access all maps. However, you can only hunt 5 species for free (whitetail deer, pheasant, and three rabbit species). The free species are on all but one map. All other species require a license that you can either earn by doing missions for in-game currency (gm$) or buy with real money (em$). You can even earn em$ by doing sponsor deals (which I have not done, so I can't tell you whether or not I recommend it). You cannot shoot animals you don't have a license for. You are given two weapons (12GA Single Shot Shotgun and .243 Bolt-Action Rifle with unlimited ammo) and a few other items for free to start your hunting. This shotgun is legal for every species in the game as long as you're using the correct shells (birdshot, buckshot, or slugs), the rifle is legal for mid-sized animals including the Whitetail. Check the wiki for more information.Between the missions for the 5 free species, you can earn plenty of gm$ to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chances of being successful, and even buy licenses for additional species. That's all without spending any real money. This route should be considered more of a demo to the full game, as it teaches you about the basics of what the game has to offer. Once you're convinced that the full version is worth the money, you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription. Subscribers unlock all animals, maps, and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription. Bundles are the best value if you're just getting into the game, however. Bundles include a subscription and a host of weapons and equipment. I would HIGHLY recommend the Trailrunner Bundle ($49.99), which includes a year's subscription and a HOST of weapons and equipment. When your year's subsription is ending, you can renew your subscription for another full year for only $34.99. There are tons of extra weapons and equipment you can buy a-la-carte with em$ (real money). I've spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and I don't regret it. I love hunting and this is the best hunting game out there. You don't have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though. You can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for $49.99. The subscription is fair and necessary because the devs are CONSTANTLY updating the game and adding new maps, species, and other features. Even if you don't want to spend money on the game, you can download what is a great free whitetail deer hunting game.Before you go trashing a great game, do some research on what you're actually getting into. It is not fair at all to the devs or long-time players who want this game to be supported for years to come.

125,12094,12098,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewSo yeah, then there's this game.  I was really excited about getting a new MMO to play and was a bit sad with the result.  My issue isn't with the down servers or FPS issues or any of the bugs that will get worked out.  My issue is with the following items:1. Region, they've moved this game to be english but haven't even added in the UK english keyboards, what this means is that the keys that aren't on an american keyboard don't work.2. Translation, they've missed a lot of things in the translation leaving people stuck (including myself for a while) stuck in the beginning phase not able to complete the into missions and join the actual game.  I had to watch a video on how to pass the intro in order to progress into the game itself due to bad instructions.3. Censorship, I understand censoring things to a degree, I was a bit dissapointed that they took out the nudity but can accept that as a marketing item.  What I don't understand is that they removed words such as Button and a number of others so you have trouble communicating in game with outher people.  4. Gameplay, the combat system, though unique is a pain to use.  It doesn't feel natural or even fun when (using a UK keyboard) you have to travel all the way from the WASD keys to the area near the enter key to switch stances in the middle of combat, sorry but nobody's hand is that large.  Not to mention that the key combo's to hit 1 then R or T, etc. don't really feel right when fighting.  The beginning mobs are tough enough that they can kill you in the beginning when you're trying to get used to it making it not quite an enjoyable experience.  It may have just been me but even the combat motions though pretty seem disconnected and made me feel that this was a bit dated for some reason, maybe I just don't like the game engine or something.  5. Questing, the quest and storyline felt empty to me.  Not sure if it's the bad translation or if it's something deeper but I kept feeling disconnected and empty trying to play through and kept giving up.  Even from the beginning you have to choose a side and are forced (or at least I was) into once side for some reason I can't figure out and still have no idea what either side stands for.  Bit of a mess really.Normally when I get a new game I play it for hours on end till I get a feeling of this but with Bless I kept having to force myself to try to get into it and wasn't able to find anything that made me want to go back other than the face that I paid money for this.That's me done for a change, at least I figured it out early on :/ ",0, early access reviewso yeah game excited getting new mmo play bit sad result issue servers fps issues bugs worked issue following region moved game english added uk english keyboards means keys american keyboard translation missed lot things translation leaving people stuck including stuck beginning phase able complete missions join actual game watch video pass intro order progress game bad censorship understand censoring things degree bit dissapointed took nudity accept marketing item understand removed words button number trouble communicating game outher people gameplay combat system unique pain use feel natural fun uk keyboard travel way wasd keys area near enter key switch stances middle combat sorry hand large mention key combo hit r t etc feel right fighting beginning mobs tough kill beginning trying making enjoyable experience combat motions pretty disconnected feel bit dated reason maybe like game engine questing quest storyline felt sure bad translation deeper kept feeling disconnected trying play kept giving beginning choose forced reason figure idea stands bit mess normally new game play hours end till feeling bless kept having force try able find want face paid money change figured early

133,1888,1891,Dota 2,"Dota is less of a game, more of a tool of self discovery. In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun. Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either.Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be.Although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway – remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.)The interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥блять' and 'no courier gg my team are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful. If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret.

137,9233,9237,PlanetSide 2,"Planetside 2 is one of those games with an unusual combination of genres. However, it works in this game's advantage, because it is worked out really well.Coming back to my point earlier, a fps mixed with a MMO isn't the combination you think of when making a game. Or it is, but very hard to work out. Planetside 2 did this very well. There are 3 unique worlds where you aim for domination by claiming land as your own. There are also 3 teams/replubics who are part of this battle. In short, only 1 world already contains thousands of players, duking it out to be the victor. That is just so much fun and works correctly.There are 6 classes to choose from, so you can choose the character that fits you the most. Your class has different weapons and styles depending on the replubic you choose. This also comes in the form of varying vehicles, which also work very well in this game. There are both land vehicles and airplanes, and both are easy to handle once you get the hang on it.It will take some time before you have built your character with customizations and weapons, but trust me, it is definitely worth it. And if you're not sure about what weapon to choose, you can hire them for some time or test them out for free as much as you want in the training section.There are 3 worlds in total. One being Indar, the kind of desert world. Most of the time that world is also most crowed. On the other hand you have Esamir, the snow world. This one is usually the most quiet. And finally, there is Amerish, which is a Jungle world. This one is mixed on people.There is one negative point that I also have to mention. That one being Character Customization, which is not or almost not part of this game. Everybody looks the exact same depending on your class. You are able to give you armor and weapons several colors, but this will cost you real life money, and it is not worth it.Planetside 2 is definitely worth checking out. I would advice picking this up with friends though, because it can be a bit boring when you go alone.",1, planetside games unusual combination genres works game advantage worked coming point earlier fps mixed mmo combination think making game hard work planetside unique worlds aim domination claiming land teams replubics battle short world contains thousands players duking victor fun works correctly classes choose choose character fits class different weapons styles depending replubic choose comes form varying vehicles work game land vehicles airplanes easy handle hang time built character customizations weapons trust definitely worth sure weapon choose hire time test free want training section worlds total indar kind desert world time world crowed hand esamir snow world usually quiet finally amerish jungle world mixed people negative point mention character customization game everybody looks exact depending class able armor weapons colors cost real life money worth planetside definitely worth checking advice picking friends bit boring
138,14564,14569,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewAs of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. Ill be talking about some major points.1: Weapons2: Types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bots3: Rewards after each match4: The matching system5: Removed tech tree6: Pilot Seat Removed1: WeaponsThere are 3 major weapons I want to talk about. A: The worst one of them all, the Rocket Launcher B: Anti-air C: Shotguns.A: Rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. To use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. One rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. It can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. Basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.B: Anti-Air guns, Flak cannons. THey are absolute cancer when it comes to ANYTHING that flies or hovers. They detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for Mechs who jump or Crawlers who jump too. They cost the LEAST and have the same explosive radius as the strongest Plasma Cannons, which is horse crap. They do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. Some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.C: Shotguns. THese things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. They can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. THey do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. They are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: Bots. There are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. A: Mechs B: Box Fliers C: Helis with rockets A: Mechs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. THey have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. The most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. These bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. You can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. You can have LITTERALLY everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ♥♥♥♥ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. If you put Pilots Seats back, it would make Mechs a lot harder to build and use.B: Box fliers. These things are the absolute worst. They dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. They do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.C: Helis with Rockets. These things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by Plasma Cannons or sometimes SMGs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: Rewards. Ok so, the rewards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its chance. You could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. But if you get it, yaaay. You dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. I prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: Matching system. They have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 Pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 Pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: Tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. A new player could buy the second strongest Plasma Cannon with ease, same with the SMG. Then refere to the Matching System above6: Pilot Seat Removed: Naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot AND give it the best fire power possible AND it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one shot.Some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. If a Plasma Cannon user came up against an SMG user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the SMGs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. I think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thoseSummary: Anything that flies is NEXT TO ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS! Rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, Flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, Box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. Mechs need a nerf too. If you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns.

143,3810,3813,Team Fortress 2,"It feels almost sad to me to watch TF2 now, sure it's still more of the same but I can't help but feel that the love that was once there isn't there anymore. This game is what pulled me from Xbox to PC so why do I just feel pity for this game running on for so long when I used to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on PC with no end in sight? I think it stems back to what I'd call the 'peak' of TF2 (In my time of being around) which I felt was Love & War because I remember how the game that was just becoming a little too stale got the biggest injection of life and fun with new taunts, weapons and all around great memories. However I noticed something off after a week or so, the community was becoming 2 factions and I had never seen this before, one side wanting to conga and party the other wanting a hardcore pub server every match. I kept on playing though. When a trailer named ""End of the Line"" came out my hype was beyond containing and I thought up so many weapons I've seen that will possibly come to life on update day. I had so many thoughts of how this is the update to end the game, one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need. When Finally on December 8th we were hit with a crushing reality where this update that had so much hype for turned into a simple cosmetic update and I was crushed. I kept playing though. With a pit in my stomach the new update rolled out with quite a split, Gun Mettle. CS:GO skins in TF2 and people thought the world was ending and to top it off this update was a pay to play update to start the campaign. However I was loving every second of the new group tanut and the Snowplow map, not to mention I was in love with some skins. Like all good things though I was quickly brought back down to sadness when Invasion hit. It had sounded like there would be new weapons and a new game mode from all the hype. The game mode was average at most and the reskins turned my love for the game to anger and I left for Payday for quite a while. I returned midway in the Tough Break update when I saw a similar but different game. The magic was just gone for me at this point and soon enough other games caught my eye, mainly Overwatch. Where TF2 grew stale with me other people kept going. I full departure from TF2 was Meet Your Match when I felt as if TF2 changed so drastically to just compete with Overwatch's rapid growth in competitive play. Sure I've been reading and it looks like TF2 is back to how it's been for 9 years just with a different hat stacked on it's head again. I'm not saying you should quit TF2 because Overwatch is just better or anything. I just want to explain about how I broke away from this game and things I felt after 4 years on this game and many disappointments. So if you enjoy TF2 still then more power to you and if you hate TF2 with a burning passion then I don’t care about that either. All this review is for is to say my peace about TF2 before I’m done with it for good.",0, feels sad watch sure help feel love anymore game pulled xbox pc feel pity game running long want watch unstoppable titan pc end sight think stems peak time felt love war remember game little stale got biggest injection life fun new taunts weapons great memories noticed week community factions seen wanting conga party wanting hardcore pub server match kept playing trailer named end line came hype containing thought weapons seen possibly come life update day thoughts update end game bang want need finally december hit crushing reality update hype turned simple cosmetic update crushed kept playing pit stomach new update rolled split gun mettle cs skins people thought world ending update pay play update start campaign loving second new group tanut snowplow map mention love skins like good things quickly brought sadness invasion hit sounded like new weapons new game mode hype game mode average reskins turned love game anger left payday returned midway tough break update saw similar different game magic gone point soon games caught eye mainly overwatch grew stale people kept going departure meet match felt changed drastically compete overwatch rapid growth competitive play sure reading looks like years different hat stacked head saying quit overwatch better want explain broke away game things felt years game disappointments enjoy power hate burning passion care review peace good

147,428,430,Sakura Clicker,"Some folks are going to hate on this because I like this game Unironicly. No, I don't consider this a Hentai game. This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player. The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up. Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while. Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.The game may also have interesting updates in the future.

148,17446,17451,EverQuest II,"My referral link (can use existing account if you haven't played for 6 months): http://alturl.com/t74ogEverquest II is an open-world MMORPG whose basic controls are similar to World of Warcraft, but whose integral mechanics and interface are quite different (and really, dramatically superior.)As an SOE game, Everquest II shares its Station Cash currency with all other SOE games: Everquest 1, DC Universe Online, PlanetSide 2, and even Free Realms. Because of this, taking advantage of SC-related offers in one game is redeemable in any other game.LORE AND SETTINGEverquest II takes place in a low-mid-fantasy world. Although it has fairies and lizard people and other stuff, they are portrayed relatively realistically. Early locations in particular are quite grounded and not really all that fantastic or colorful.Fortunately, Everquest II doesn't take its seemingly-serious setting very seriously, especially compared to WoW, and much of the setting is self-deprecating (try learning Faerlie.) Despite that, it has a few rules in its lore that limit the player just a smidgen.For instance, the playable classes are aligned good, neutral, or evil... as are the races. If you pick a ""good"" class, you can't pick an ""evil"" race, and vice versa; even though you can Betray your alignment and play as the opposite once you reach level 10. This is a bit of a bummer.On the plus side, you will automatically start with knowledge of your race's language (in addition to ""Common"") and thus not have to do a quest to learn it.COMBATLike World of Warcraft, you have strafe and turn buttons, left-click turns the camera without turning you, and right-click turns the camera while turning you. You must target -before- using a skill and are subject to ""implied target"" (e.g. casting heal on an enemy will heal your friend being attacked by said enemy instead), two things I've never been fond of. However, you don't have to be facing an enemy at the time you choose to attack it - your character will just turn and face them before attacking.Some enemies are linked together in parties called encounters, and attacking one of them will cause -all- of them to retaliate. Encounters can get into the dozens for creatures like herd animals and raiders.Your character's ""auto-attacks"" are a bit slow, especially at the start of the game. Your primary means of sustained damage will therefore be skill spams. Although skills consume Power, it's very rare (at least in the early levels) to run out of it, as it isn't spent very quickly and it renegerates more rapidly when not in combat.The game uses the logically questionable hate / threat system wherein you can force NPC enemies to only ever attack your tank despite any reasonable combatant knowing that your healer or mage would be better to take out first.Developing your character's combat abilities relies on several factors.- Ordinary experience gain and level, which will give you most of your skills and raise their Rank;- Character and Focus traits, earned on level multiples and giving you further boosts to certain skills or stats;- Alternate Advancement (Lv 10+), earned alongside of but separately to level and spent to obtain new skills and power up existing ones; and- Research (Lv 20+), allowing you to increase skill Mastery (separate from Rank but every bit as important.) You can research at any time but it will take hours to days to finish research.- Prestige (much higher than Lv. 20) is basically badder♥♥♥♥♥AA.Your account status determines how high you can raise your skill Masteries via Research.- Free accounts can only raise up to Adept (3rd level of mastery.)- Silver account (one-time $5.00 charge to keep permanently) can raise up to Expert (4th level of mastery.)- Gold account (subscription) can research up to Grandmaster (6th and final level of mastery.)You don't have to have these account status to USE the skills at that mastery, or to acquire them through non-Research means - you just need that status to Research up to that level.MENTORING & CHRONOMAGEGot a friend to play? Already level 60 when your friend just started at level 1?NO PROBLEM.Party with them and you can temporarily lower yourself to match their level. Your skills and gear will power down too, but it will still be better than a natural of the target level.What's that? You want to go hunt low-level gear for Transmute but you're too high so they don't drop? And you don't have a friend of that level?NO PROBLEM.Go find the Chronomages in Qeynos and temporarily level down to any multiple of 5.CRAFTINGOf all MMO's I have played, Everquest II plays second in its crafting system only to Vanguard. Like Vanguard, crafting level is separate from adventure level and the player participates in a small minigame to craft, but it isn't anywhere near as engaging or strategic - you merely craft in four-second increments and press one of your six skill buttons to counter problems. Unlike Vanguard, crafting of any kind is integrally tied to adventure, or else you won't be able to safely gather ingredients yourself. You will also more or less be unable to mastercraft.Crafting also benefits from its own separate Alternate Advancement, and with Chains of Eternity you can also get Crafting Prestige. However, these AA's are earned with crafting experience and not adventure experience.MOUNTS AND AESTHETICGuess what? You can use mounts in combat. No worries!Everquest II is also smart enough to realize that costume items shouldn't give you any stats, so they don't.Anything you can put in an equipment slot that changes your appearance can be put in the equivalent appearance slot (including mounts.) The only drawback? You can't put ""nothing"" in your appearance slot unless you purchase the invisible costume items during a city festival (e.g. invisible gloves so your hands look bare.) However, you can toggle on and off your headgear, your cape, and your mount (Character window --> Options.)Upon reaching level 20, you can give your character a last name, which can be changed for free once a week. You can also change your prefix and / or suffix title whenever you want, assuming you've earned one.CLOSINGEverquest II is a fine game by modern standards, though it has a few quirks I would change.Remember to Transmute all equipment you no longer need or else you will be gimped in Transmute until you can chronomage at level 20.",1, referral link use existing account played months ii open world mmorpg basic controls similar world warcraft integral mechanics interface different dramatically soe game everquest ii shares station cash currency soe games everquest dc universe online planetside free realms taking advantage sc related offers game redeemable game lore settingeverquest ii takes place low mid fantasy world fairies lizard people stuff portrayed relatively realistically early locations particular grounded fantastic colorful fortunately everquest ii seemingly setting seriously especially compared wow setting self deprecating try learning faerlie despite rules lore limit player smidgen instance playable classes aligned good neutral evil races pick good class pick evil race vice versa betray alignment play opposite reach level bit bummer plus automatically start knowledge race language addition common quest learn combatlike world warcraft strafe turn buttons left click turns camera turning right click turns camera turning target skill subject implied target casting heal enemy heal friend attacked said enemy instead things fond facing enemy time choose attack character turn face attacking enemies linked parties called encounters attacking cause retaliate encounters dozens creatures like herd animals raiders character auto attacks bit slow especially start game primary means sustained damage skill spams skills consume power rare early levels run spent quickly renegerates rapidly combat game uses logically questionable hate threat system force npc enemies attack tank despite reasonable combatant knowing healer mage better developing character combat abilities relies ordinary experience gain level skills raise character focus traits earned level multiples giving boosts certain skills alternate advancement lv earned alongside separately level spent obtain new skills power existing ones research lv allowing increase skill mastery separate rank bit important research time hours days finish prestige higher lv basically badder account status determines high raise skill masteries free accounts raise adept level silver account time charge permanently raise expert level gold account subscription research grandmaster final level account status use skills mastery acquire non research means need status research level mentoring chronomagegot friend play level friend started level temporarily lower match level skills gear power better natural target level want hunt low level gear transmute high drop friend find chronomages qeynos temporarily level multiple mmo played everquest ii plays second crafting system vanguard like vanguard crafting level separate adventure level player participates small minigame craft near engaging strategic merely craft second increments press skill buttons counter problems unlike vanguard crafting kind integrally tied adventure wo able safely gather ingredients unable mastercraft crafting benefits separate alternate advancement chains eternity crafting prestige aa earned crafting experience adventure experience mounts aestheticguess use mounts combat ii smart realize costume items stats equipment slot changes appearance equivalent appearance slot including mounts drawback appearance slot purchase invisible costume items city festival invisible gloves hands look bare toggle headgear cape mount character window reaching level character changed free week change prefix suffix title want assuming earned closingeverquest ii fine game modern standards quirks change remember transmute equipment longer need gimped transmute chronomage level

150,3964,3967,Team Fortress 2,"Let me start by saying I used to frequent this location often. The service is normally great and on any other day of the week I could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip.However, since the new change in management, the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared. I can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff.To say the new waiters and ""chefs"" are unbearable is an understatement. The new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children. When my family and I went in this evening for dinner, no one moved to greet or seat us until about 15 minutes after we arrived. I spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar. I eventually cleared my throat and asked ""Is it seat yourself, today?"" Then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said ""Actually no, it's not."" She proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us. After scratching her♥♥♥♥♥in front of me, my wife, and our three children, she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house. Looking at the menu, I could see her greasy handprint remaining.Twenty minutes later, a waitress approached us, did not say a word, started writing on her pad, and then just walked away. She came back 5 minutes later with five glasses of water, none of which had ice. She blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again.Five minutes after that, another waitress came out. This time, she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening. When we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress, she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff. She assured us next time we come back we can expect better service. She got us more menus, wiped down the table, and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table. Things finally seemed to start turning around.After we placed our order, we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant. The carpets were new, there was music playing, and the tables, when clean, were quite comfortable. For a moment, we thought were in the clear.Just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve, it was ruined again. We heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff. Several people (who sounded quite young) were shouting ""Do it, do it!"" Immediately I was alarmed. There were not many people seated at the restaurant. I could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food.Our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped. The first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food, all of them hiding a grin.My wife looked alarmed. My children were oblivious. I said ""Thank you,"" but they didn't walk away. My wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich, but I stopped her. I picked up it and opened it. The three standing beside our table started looking nervous.""Something wrong, sir?"" The second waitress asked.""I suppose we're going to find out,"" I responded. I opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich. Most languages don't have the words to concisely describe the taste, but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt.I spat up the food immediately. I stood up, pushed the three aside, grabbed my family and left. The manager heard the commotion and made his way to us. I can't believe myself, but I simply gave him the middle finger, right in front of my children, and proceeded out of the restaurant. In the car ride home, I kept wincing at the aftertaste.

172,17184,17189,School of Dragons,"""School of Dragons"" is such a cute game. While there is a bit of negative pointers in my opinion, I do recommend this to those who do not mind  simple gaming. Withing the two hours I been playing ""School of Dragons"", I realize it's nothing to be overjoyed about however it is a game to waste some time at if your day consists of nothing other than staring at a clock. Graphics: I have seen better graphics in a lot of games, but these are not bad. However, depending on how smooth your computer runs things; the graphics may look different to other players. Worst yet, there is no options to lower the standards except to window/fullscreen the game perhaps.   6/10GamePlay: There is nothing special about this game play, do quest, raise your dragon and do mini-games. Pretty repetitive but again most games tend to be. You're lucky to get mini-games out of this as other games may not have that. 4/10Maps/Areas: School of Dragons have a few different maps to choose from which is nice to see despite they may not be very big. Sadly, there needs to be a stronger format/coding/ect as some players can get stuck in some places or appear as if they are in mid-jump on a bridge. It's not horrifying though and can easily be ignored if you don't run your dragon into the ground in tight areas. 5/10Bugs: There is a few bugs that can be easily spotted. I had an issue when I first entered the game; After hopping on Toothless, it showed the rings we had to go through but after Hiccup finished talking they disappeared and I was unable to proceed to the next area. All you need to do is restart the game and it will be fine. Some other bugs will not be mentioned as they are not dramatic. While I don't feel like breaking this whole game apart due to it's childish gameplay, I will mention that this game is not as awful as people have made it seem. Yes it has it's down points like any other game, yes there are options to pay in-game however it is not Pay to Play* and yes it's a child's game. **The game offers in-game payment options to be a member. This does not mean it's ""Pay to Play"" as pay to play simply means to use real currency to continue in the game, become stronger/immortal, and unlock classes etc that are not available any other way.

176,11771,11775,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewBless Online's publisher Neowiz pulled off the best bait of 2018 so far.This is as close to click bait you'll see from me but I promise there's a review in here somewhere.I'm not going to waste your time and explain who Shroud is, if you know who he is great, but for those that don't, context is a lot of gamers watch his streams, and thousands of them try and kill him everyday in something called ""stream-sniping""So, the creators of Bless Online, allegedly(I've reached out to both Neowiz and Mr Shroud to see if this is true) paid him a handsome sum to play the game on launch day.His popularity sold copies of the game at a meteoric pace, suddenly servers began crashing and BLESS began to look like any other MMO launch an numerous players couldn't login for whatever reason.Here's the thing. These launch day jitters were actually disguising many core issues with the game players would have immediate noticed. The game wasn't new or actually in early access it was attempting it's third launch after failing twice to find an audience, without getting into tech specs and details I'll sum it up: The game runs horribly, features static combat with awkward controls, even after rebinding keys the combos still felt horrible. It felt forced and heavy handed.It's the gaming equivalent of ""The Room"" or ""Troll 2"". It wasn't even how bad it ran, it was the hilarious expectation for players to pay for an initial copy of the game, a subscription to the game($14.99 per month), and then micro-transactions you'd expect to find in a F2P mmo.All of this paired with a murky launch and intentional obfuscation, every gamer wants to PK Shroud while he's streaming. Led to Steam lifting it's usual refund policy and refunding any player who purchased the game refund it during the grace period.I gotta hand it to Neowiz, they picked the right streamer, they just pitched the wrong game. Attached are some of the funnier things about Bless. It had exactly one redeeming mechanic, you could tame and train mounts for almost all of the NPCs.Bless Online: 0.5 out of 10 (I officially have a WORST GAME EVER PLAYED)",0, early access reviewbless online publisher neowiz pulled best bait far close click bait promise review going waste time explain shroud know great context lot gamers watch streams thousands try kill everyday called stream creators bless online reached neowiz mr shroud true paid handsome sum play game launch day popularity sold copies game meteoric pace suddenly servers began crashing bless began look like mmo launch numerous players login reason thing launch day jitters actually disguising core issues game players immediate noticed game new actually early access attempting launch failing twice find audience getting tech specs details sum game runs horribly features static combat awkward controls rebinding keys combos felt horrible felt forced heavy handed gaming equivalent room troll bad ran hilarious expectation players pay initial copy game subscription month micro transactions expect find mmo paired murky launch intentional obfuscation gamer wants pk shroud streaming led steam lifting usual refund policy refunding player purchased game refund grace period got ta hand neowiz picked right streamer pitched wrong game attached funnier things bless exactly redeeming mechanic tame train mounts npcs bless online officially worst game played

187,7854,7858,Trove,"Trove is a good game, but it has it's draw backs. Many of which can be blamed on two things. 1. Some severe lag issues: For some people I hear the game doesn't even start. I haven't yet encountered that myself, and it runs fine for the most part for me, but there are moments where things just kinda break. Then again, try playing a game that doesn't have a glitch of some kind.2. Pay2Win: Now this I can understand. I have seen the market place, and it is very restrictive on what you can get without pouring dollars into this game. HOWEVER: Like Warframe,(I know, of all games, why draw comparisons to that one. Hang with me, pls.) you can do just fine without spending a dime. Of course, it will take a helluva lot more time to do, but maybe it's worth it.Despite that, I do reccomend this game, because of 3 things:1. Friendly: It is a very nice game. In every way it is warm. All nearby players get the loot that drops, and there is no fierce competition over that Shadow lvl 3 staff; death isn't overly punishing, and the game gives you a pretty good start, and then encourages you to engage with the community.2. Rewards cooperation: You get more together. When you're fighting with a team, all of you get XP, and all of you get loot. Even better, the punishment of death can be lessened when you have a team that can revive. Building becomes easier, and higher level characters can provide gear to lesser levels to help them gain rank.3. Appeals to a very large audience: Everyone: young, old, builders, adventurers, people who like pretty places and people who like hell. Everyone will have a place in Trove. There are many different classes for people of many different playstyles, and each one can be tailored via the gear you get, and the gem system. Threre are clubs for the different types of people, those who like adventuring will be greeted very well by adventuring clubs, builders can show off there talents to eachother at building clubs, and so on. And the best part is that everyone progresses through their respective intrests in similar ways, resulting in a place where different interests collide and then are sewn together in a rather lovely way.There is no way I could put this on the 1 to 10 scale and be accurate, so I'll give it a 89/100.

188,11061,11065,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewIts a good and fair game. Probably has the best returns for investments of any of the digital TCGs floating around on the market. You get a lot of stuff for just investing a minimum amount of time. Also the most interesting features (Gauntlet, Forge and Draft) are fairly accessible - a few games and gauntlet runs here and there will keep you with a constant flow of in-game currency, which allows you to participate in all of them .So why am I giving this a thumbs down ? - There is one MAJOR game-breaking element in here: RNG - its a mess in this game - literally the ONLY reason (ok 90% ...) why I lose games is either getting mana-screwed or getting flooded - even with an absolutely decent manabase and fixing/fetching - its frustrating - its pure randomness - and allthough we cant avoid this in in real life TCGs it should be avoided in digital games as it doesnt add ANYTHING but frustration.If you are running a decent manabase the RNG shouldnt be the deciding factor in games like this. Its frustrating to lose to it and its also no fun to win because your enemy got screwed or flooded. It should be skill and deckbuilding that is deciding digital TCGs not randomness. And I`ve lost too many times to utter randomness in this game to give it a thumbs up.Still its a decent and fair game most of the time and has probably the best rewards system of all the digital TCGs out there.",0, early access reviewits good fair game probably best returns investments digital tcgs floating market lot stuff investing minimum time interesting features gauntlet forge draft fairly accessible games gauntlet runs constant flow game currency allows participate giving thumbs major game breaking element rng mess game literally reason ok lose games getting mana screwed getting flooded absolutely decent manabase fixing fetching frustrating pure randomness allthough nt avoid real life tcgs avoided digital games nt add frustration running decent manabase rng nt deciding factor games like frustrating lose fun win enemy got screwed flooded skill deckbuilding deciding digital tcgs randomness lost times utter randomness game thumbs decent fair game time probably best rewards system digital tcgs
189,2110,2113,Path of Exile,"One of the greatest concepts ever. The highly customizable builds makes this game sometimes a bit too much enjoyable actually, beside the fact the desync is a thing since release.

Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it! You need to make this game enjoyable yourself by asking help of others as well, the game is kind of hard to get into but once you're in it's hard to get out.

I have to pay money to play it. Konami only wants my money!- No, you don't have to pay anything. Through lots of gameplay and grinding, you can earn any card. I've been playing it for almost quite a while now and I've only paid money once - and I did it 'cause I wanted to, not 'cause I felt like I had to do it. And it's not pay-to-win, which most free games are.2. The events suck!!- I will admit that there have been events that were lackluster, but most of them are great opportunities to get new cards and unlock characters.3. All of the new cards they're releasing now suck!!- You do realize how many cards there are in the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, right? And if you know the game, you know that not all of the cards are great. That's just how the game is. And the game has been doing a great job of constantly adding new cards to try out - and also, they resently released the Yubel cards, which are super powerful. So you can't say that all the cards they're releasing suck.But in the end, I personally love playing it and that's all that really matters to me. It's fun and it's free.

Bad design choices, bad design choices everywhere. I won't go super detailed as some old veterans, like Juvar23, so I will just quickly comment on why I stopped recommending this game to my friends: The last update, Epic Loot, was a good idea. But they executed it in a manner that it feels like one of these mobile games with a life spam of 1-year or less, made to extract the biggest amount possible of money. It's unrewarding, it's relentless, it's not fitting for a game with the premise of BUILDING things. The issue is, the mind behind Freejam, Mark Simmons, is too dellusional over his own work to admit it's flaws, effectively leading the game to disaster.

205,14429,14434,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewWAS the Awesomenes Construction Simulator 2014. That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.I have Built:M-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1M-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.UT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.Terran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.Terran Ar♥♥♥♥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-♥♥♥♥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping your♥♥♥♥♥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ♥♥♥♥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like your♥♥♥♥♥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10.

207,9102,9106,PlanetSide 2,"The game is solid. I have about 38 hours on my steam account, but I've played the game for about 200-300 hours before it was on Steam.It's a good game, you can check its undeniable qualities among good reviews around, but it has serious issues that still haven't been resolved after all these years.- The faction balancing is very poor in regard of the Vanu; they are always (and it's been consistent for 3 to 4 years) more numerous than any other faction, which makes it almost impossible to win big battles against them, or even small skirmishes since they have the most veterans of the game. (EDIT: I re-tried the game for the first time since a few months, and I fought (and died instantly) against swarms of Vanu players that had 20-30x more time in the game than me, so around 4000 gaming hours each. The game is now half empty, and the players left seem to be all lvl 2000-3000 Vanu veterans that will murder you without giving you a single chance of finding fun in the game. Just so it's clear.)- You can't properly play solo to the game; if you're not with a considerable team, it's extremely complicated to join bigger squads for large battles on the fly, plus, there aren't really any chain of command, so orders either get lost or it's pure chaos, which can be fun util you go back to my first point: you can't win against Vanu if you don't organize your assault properly. Sure, you're gonna have some great moments if you try just to play alone, even in large scale assaults, but they're not gonna be enough to outgrow the constant frustrations.- The F2P model isn't quite F2P. Sure you can stick to it and not spend a single penny on the game, and you should fare just OK. But it brings an even more massive problem:- The progression is terribly slow. It's fun to fight and get points to spend in new skills, weapons, vehicles (aerial and terrestrial), upgrades for your shields, for the ammo you can carry, for the weapons of your vehicles, etc - until you realize that you need the SAME type of currency won in-game to unlock them all. You can't get said currency without playing a LOT - if you're outrageously lucky and proactive you can get up to 200-250 points in an hour of gameplay, but this is barely enough for two or three levels of any kind of upgrade, and I'm not even mentioning weapons, which can cost a few thousands and not be worthwile, or be completely unfairly strong. You can get these points a LOT faster by paying the premium fee, plus a few other bonuses; the game isn't P2W, but considering the really, really, really useful and advantageous nature of the upgrades you can get for everything in the game, players who pay get a lot stronger a lot faster.- Finally, my last point concerns the state of the server. It's actually pretty good, with a little twist: this is a massive scale FPS, making Battlefield look like a claustrophobic's nightmare; therefore, for the server to pick up the informations coming out of your PC, to transmit it to the server, and to do the same with every other character and object in the game, that takes a gargantuous amount of bandwidth; if your connexion isn't top notch, top tier, top whatever you want, you'll be gravely disadvantaged - a lot more than in any other FPS. In comparison, I have a pretty lousy connexion at the moment, which is new to me, but I fare just well in Rainbow Six Siege. In PS2 though, I'm barely more than a moving meatbag with a ""SHOOT ME"" sign on his back.So, TL;DR: All in all, PlanetSide 2 is a good game. If you don't mind paying for the premium access (or if you're really patient), if you have large teams (like a guild or something like that) to play with at all time, if you're lucky on the amount of Vanu against you and if your connexion rocks, this game is a must. But without all that, it's gonna give you a hard time pretty much all the time. Try it (it's free after all), and make your own opinion on the game.",0, game solid hours steam account played game hours steam good game check undeniable qualities good reviews issues resolved faction balancing poor regard vanu consistent years numerous faction makes impossible win big battles small skirmishes veterans game edit tried game time months fought died instantly swarms vanu players time game gaming hours game half players left lvl vanu veterans murder giving single chance finding fun game properly play solo game considerable team extremely complicated join bigger squads large battles fly plus chain command orders lost pure chaos fun util point win vanu organize assault properly sure gon na great moments try play large scale assaults gon na outgrow constant model sure stick spend single penny game fare ok brings massive progression terribly slow fun fight points spend new skills weapons vehicles aerial terrestrial upgrades shields ammo carry weapons vehicles etc realize need type currency won game unlock said currency playing lot outrageously lucky proactive points hour gameplay barely levels kind upgrade mentioning weapons cost thousands worthwile completely unfairly strong points lot faster paying premium fee plus bonuses game considering useful advantageous nature upgrades game players pay lot stronger lot finally point concerns state server actually pretty good little twist massive scale fps making battlefield look like claustrophobic nightmare server pick informations coming pc transmit server character object game takes gargantuous bandwidth connexion notch tier want gravely disadvantaged lot fps comparison pretty lousy connexion moment new fare rainbow siege barely moving meatbag shoot sign planetside good game mind paying premium access patient large teams like guild like play time lucky vanu connexion rocks game gon na hard time pretty time try free opinion game

211,10779,10783,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThe game mechanics are good and the concept of building your own deck custom tailored to your own play style is promising.Unforunately, once you enter the ranked modus and play a few matches the first thing you realize is, that most of the people just use 9/5 decks that they looked up on eternalwarcry.The second thing you notice is that players with legendary cards simply crush you in every possible way. You already tickled the oppponents health down to around 5 points. Next turn he draws one of his legendary cards and two rounds after that you're finished no matter what you do. I know legendary cards should be really powerful but if you encounter in ranked modus Tier 3 Bronze Players with several legendary cards in their deck it simply feels frustrating. Bottom Line: Have no fun at customizing your deck for lack of cards and the option of simply copying other people's decks. Stillwant to build your deck on your own?

222,7094,7098,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I don't know about Hearthstone as I never played it, but I can't help but notice it's comparison with Magic the Gathering which I played for many years. Let me start off by saying I think this game is really good, if you've played MtG than you'll notice it's very similar yet with a slightly streamlined style which works very well. For a start you don't have to tap cards, and instead of declaring attackers and choosing defenders, this game has implemented a sytem where you directly choose who you want your creatures to attack. This makes the game play very smoothly and it's much quicker too. The drawback this game has in comparison however is that it does lack the same level of depth as MtG as there's less phases to the game, such as you can't case instant spells or react to enemy moves. However, what this game does so well is implement a few other mechanics which retain a level of depth which keeps the game challenging and engaging. One of these is the prophesy/rune system which allows you to draw a particular card in reaction to being attacked at certain stages of the game, this system actually allows for a bit of reaction play such as tapping down an attacker if they're making a critical attack in the last moment. Another great thing about the prophesy system is that it allows the losing player to draw extra cards which forces the later stages of the game to remain challenging for both players. Another interesting system is the lanes mechanic which means you have to plan ahead which side of the board you want to play cards, this works very well and adds yet more depth to the game.As a MtG player I've found it very easy to translate my skills directly across to Elder Scrolls Legends, the colours mostly play the same rolls with a few aspects mixed around, there's also a lot of the same creature skills but with different names such as; breakthrough-trample, lethal-deathtouch, drain-lifelink, charge-haste, etc... although there's no flying. ESL although has it's own guard system which works well with the way it lets you choose attackers giving the defending player a sufficient way of protecting themselves.I've played through the story mode which is really fun and the rewards are satisfying and allows for great fully customised decks. The soulstone system is great allowing you to gain extra cards of choice to further improve your decks strategy. The arena mode is also great allowing you to use tickets which can be bought with real money or earned in game coins and enter as sort tournament fighting against other real players where you draft a deck on the spot from card choices. The card art is wonderful, and although there's some aspect of pay to win I've found no problem with playing my decks against other players and not getting overpowered.",1, know hearthstone played help notice comparison magic gathering played years let start saying think game good played mtg notice similar slightly streamlined style works start tap cards instead declaring attackers choosing defenders game implemented sytem directly choose want creatures attack makes game play smoothly quicker drawback game comparison lack level depth mtg phases game case instant spells react enemy moves game implement mechanics retain level depth keeps game challenging engaging prophesy rune system allows draw particular card reaction attacked certain stages game system actually allows bit reaction play tapping attacker making critical attack moment great thing prophesy system allows losing player draw extra cards forces later stages game remain challenging players interesting system lanes mechanic means plan ahead board want play cards works adds depth game mtg player found easy translate skills directly elder scrolls legends colours play rolls aspects mixed lot creature skills different names breakthrough trample lethal deathtouch drain lifelink charge haste etc flying esl guard system works way lets choose attackers giving defending player sufficient way protecting played story mode fun rewards satisfying allows great fully customised decks soulstone system great allowing gain extra cards choice improve decks strategy arena mode great allowing use tickets bought real money earned game coins enter sort tournament fighting real players draft deck spot card choices card art wonderful aspect pay win found problem playing decks players getting overpowered

It offers single player content when you aren't up for PvP and regularly hosts weekend events with special rules. It's pretty easy to earn the rewards and build a collection, whether you're looking for a competitive deck or something more imaginative and entertaining. There are also multiple modes that build your collection as you play, rather than requiring the more expensive decks full of impossibly rare cards.I'll also add that some of the people who have made or helped build this game are long-time MTG pros and former developers, so to say it is a rip-off is actually misleading. It isn't the same as lifting someone else's concept when these devs created some of that concept (I can see how that would be confusing, though).

Like most MOBA's. It started out great! The game was fun and fairly well balanced and the community was actually significantly better than the notoriously toxic community's of other MOBA's such as League of Legends. But just like every other game of it's type, it went to absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horsecockery. First and foremost, the company isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ They don't listen to the community. They get countless complaints all over about different things that are not working as intended or not working at all, severely overpowered gods, and game breaking bugs, but instead of fixing or even acknowledging those problems, they tweak a few minor details once every thousand years that make little to no difference, and are typically things that no one wants or gives aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about. The gods are so horribly unbalanced, and the less skill it takes to play your character the higher your chances of winning. (This if â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fact. Loki, Poseidon and Odin are prime examples) Out of the vast supply of existing gods currently in the game i'd say there are maybe 20 that people actually play. There are far too many instances of gods that are just plain better than others. And I don't mean counters. I mean that there are about 5 mages that are 4000x stronger than all of the other mages. And this goes for every single class. Not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of it in hopes to get more people to spend money on them. I really did love this game when i first started playing it and would easily say that at it's peak, it was the best MOBA i ever played. But just like other MOBA's i have watched it slowly decay into the bubblingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥volcano that stands before me today. I could spend so much longer talking about everything that myself and many others find wrong with this game at this point in time but I realized that i've already wasted too much.

249,14180,14185,Infestation: The New Z,"Ridicuously bad game.  Don't even waste your time with the download.Started from the moment I loaded it up--a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to even set your controls.  From there, after being harassed with spending money, trying to find a server to play on via the gameplay modes and navigating the server screens (plus, you can only sort by ping which is depicted as bars like a cellular signal) is quite cumbersome.  They somehow managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the basic essentials to like every multiplayer game ever made.Loading screen bar doesn't actually show loading progress at all.  After joining, my ping on the lowest server (US) was 600-2500ms.. I couldn't find a server that dropped below 600ms and most times they were hanging in the ~1500 range and woud even spike to 4500.  You can't see this number before actually joining the server, by the way.It only gets worse from here.  The high ping is obvious, even when picking up items/shooting zombies; essentially rendering the game uplayable.  I kept going, though, in hopes of making something of the experience.  You'll never be able to miss an item as they glow a bright blue.  Mechanics of even the basic things like walking/strafing/springing/etc. are pretty bad and shooting guns feels like I'm playing with children's toys; extremely easy to aim and do a lot of damage, but god forbid you actually are able to hit another player that isn't stationary with the delay.  People are spamming the global chat, players shoot on sight no matter what, and overall the community seems like a cest pool of inbred ♥♥♥♥tards.The inventory system and overall mechanics of items is pretty horrid--an obvious ripoff that they somehow managed to make worse.

I have only two planes (F-15, F-5) and I wish I had more. Hit me up if you wanna buy me the planes I want (F-18, Mig 21, M2000). The plane details are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and flying them feels so good. If you get a plane that's not apart of ""Flaming Cliffs"" prepare your self for 250+ page manuals on how to get your plane in the air. I recommend the F-15 as the first plane you get, why is this? I recommend it because it only takes a few buttons to start up and you don't need to trim all the time once you take off. You can have a 5 course meal and not have to worry about the F-15 rolling to the right or left unintentionally.Unlike most people, I use a yoke + throttle quadrant and others use a joy stick. Flying with a yoke is easy IMO, but it takes adjusting to figure out the perfect sensitivity. I highly recommend a yoke because it's cheaper and easier to use.The only thing I hate about this game are expensive prices for planes (it's worht it though) and no one in multiplayer. Multiplayer is absolutely deserted, and NO I'm not doing missions! Using statistics, usually 150-350 people play DCS world according to last month.

I don't even think the creators actually bothered to play their own game, otherwise they'd know they need to fix the capabilities of snipers, tanks, paratroopers, and map layout.

Whats the point in sub machine guns if the snipers tag you and snipe you before even reaching the objective? Half these maps are flat spaced with little to no cover except for skinny trees and objective points. It's like an empty sandbox from garrys mod. Where are the good maps and where is the balance? Same thing goes for tanks. Once you buy one, you can almost spawn it EVERYTIME you die and respawn. And half these tanks dont even fight other tanks. All they do is camp objectives and pick off enemy players. The cars with guns just sit at a distance and ♥♥♥♥ing snipe the players from points. Paratroopers also, all they do is flank the ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemy. Since when was airspace not an aspect of warfare? If your gonna add paratroopers, restrict them to certain airspaces so they can't just land right in the ♥♥♥♥ing middle of the objective and flank. Finally, map layout. I don't know how you can fix this but I'd assume its possible by nerfing all of the stupid aspects prior to this. Map layout and flanking. Why make a ♥♥♥♥ing bridge an objective point when people can SWIM to flank? Its stupid. You're basically telling players to hold an objective on a mountain with a small square of cover. If they peak, they get sniped or spammed with tank fire. I've only played like 8-9 hours of this game and I found THIS many flaws so far. God knows how many more there are. Don't play this game.

The game is free and if you like you can purchase more type of blocks or the Pro version, which gives you a glider, flashlight, more stamina and more storage room in your inventory. The developers are great and pretty active. Give regular updates about what they are up to via live streaming. So, why it's better than Minecraft?- It's free.- You can claim areas and give selected people permissions as to what they can and cannot do on your claim. Even the admin of the world can't do anything on your claim (except to look in your storages and take items). This is a big problem in Minecraft as people tend to steal your items.- You don't need to pay for servers, you can create your own world and let your friends play in it.- The maps are HUGE. Enough room for everyone.- Better graphics, animations and player movement.- Blueprints allow you to put your creations in the Steam workshop for others to download. You can also download blueprints of other people and use them in your world.- Burst fill allows you to build blueprints a lot quicker.

283,6981,6985,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I've been playing this game for about 3 or 4 months now and really enjoy it, my hours will say they are low because I've played through the bethesda launcher. Compared to other CCG's it is very generous. I've played f2p the entire time and have quite a nice collection of epics and legendaries. You get card rewards (including legendaries), gold, and sometimes even pack rewards for leveling up, and you get daily quests that give gold (in game currency) as well. You even get gold and cards (sometimes even a booster pack) everytime you win 3 games. You can use this gold to play arena versus players or the AI in solo arena mode. Both arena modes give fantastic rewards and is where I have gotten most of my collection so far. In fact I bought the newest ""Dark Brotherhood"" expansion entirely from in game gold I earned. The best part of this game to me is the card interaction between so many different cards, and games are not decided before a match begins because of classes or archetype. Decks are very fun to build and even after being around for the better part of a year there are still many ""new"" interactions and decks to be discovered, especially with new monthly cards and certainly future expansions. The meta is not just 1 or 2 decks like ""Quest rogue"" or ""Pirate warrior"". It is exceptionally varied and changes up quite often when new cards get released or something new is discovered. But even when the meta sticks around for a bit there are always decks to build and counter them.Another great thing about this game is the fantastic community. Between avid streamers, youtube content creators, and player-run tournaments, there are plenty of ways to have fun and learn more about the game. Some tips for new players:-Leveling up card rewards are based on your avatar you choose, and you can change it at anytime.-Arena is the best place to get packs and new cards, once you learn the game it becomes quite easy to get multiple booster packs for one arena ticket.-It is not always a good idea to just hit face because of the runes and prophecy mechanics, which make this game very interesting and strategic.",1, playing game months enjoy hours low played bethesda launcher compared ccg generous played entire time nice collection epics legendaries card rewards including legendaries gold pack rewards leveling daily quests gold game currency gold cards booster pack everytime win games use gold play arena versus players ai solo arena mode arena modes fantastic rewards gotten collection far fact bought newest dark brotherhood expansion entirely game gold earned best game card interaction different cards games decided match begins classes archetype decks fun build better year new interactions decks discovered especially new monthly cards certainly future expansions meta decks like quest rogue pirate warrior exceptionally varied changes new cards released new discovered meta sticks bit decks build counter great thing game fantastic community avid streamers youtube content creators player run tournaments plenty ways fun learn game tips new card rewards based avatar choose change best place packs new cards learn game easy multiple booster packs arena good idea hit face runes prophecy mechanics game interesting strategic

288,10945,10949,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThere's supposedly a lot of cards, but most serve little purpose outside draft.  Bold Adventurer?  Horned Vorlunk?  Any number of other cards are just worse than utility rares and legendries that have lower costs, superior abilities &c.  As to cards like Dormant Sentinel or similar high power cost cards, they don't serve much purpose outside draft, as even though they have good stats, any decent opposing deck will make key plays long before 7-drop becomes relevant.  I'd guess you could chop at *least* 25% of cards without impacting 85% of players in ranked or gauntlet modes (with the 15% exception being those players that are basically just starting out and need cards of any kind to fill out decks).Pros:  Not as grindy as Shadowverse, not as buggy as most Magic: the Gathering online releases, not as simplistic as Hearthstone, not as pushed-into-playing-the-market as Hex, has graduated design allowing players to amass commons and uncommons, then rares, without paying in (though they *will* have to grind)Cons:  Apart from the obvious ""grind"" and players without utility rares/legendaries being second class citizens - neither of which I consider *terrible* considering design aspects that compensate for each of those to *some* degree - what it comes down to for me is the game just doesn't have anything to offer apart from what it *does* offer.  It's sort of like going to a buffet and everything you see is pretty well made, but there's only five selections.

292,10136,10140,theHunter Classic,"Love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. I would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. It is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. With that being said, I'll continue with why I love the game.It is an EXCELLENT pay to play game and literally the only online game I have subscribed to aside from World Of Warcraft when I was younger. Me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing Elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. This helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. This get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. I've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.I also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency ""em$"". Aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. You can also earn ""em$"" by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an E-mail. I've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although I have spent real money on the game, if I really wanted to, I could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment I wanted.Finally I'll talk about the dev team. With regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. New areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.Many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and I can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games I've ever played and although I hope they change their pricing model some day, I'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.Edit: Also I should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). The first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. If you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (Gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. Since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. Keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. Also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours I have in the game so I'll explain why I have so many. If you leave the initial ""thehunter"" browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. I leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so I can get the latest news they have updated the game with. So if you think it's sketchy that I have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because I leave the main browser open.",1, love game reason m people hate says free play urge makers game remove free play status honest limited free play pay play game said continue love game excellent pay play game literally online game subscribed aside world warcraft younger buddy girlfreind spend hours time stalking killing elk amazing tracking system detailed injury system allowing exactly organs hit animal collect kill helps precise fast kill time eventually leading shooting wildly animal tracking forever shooting animal exactly vital organs killing swift killshot better use weapons silent like bows crossbows enabling kil animals quick silently alerting heard travelling taken doiwn animals silent swipe buddy making tandem kills picking animals lagging rest heard enjoy different ways earn game real money currency aside spending cash earn completing competitions free memebrship difficult basic package allows kill nearly animals exception require specific equipment competition chance achieve victory dedicated earn completeing simple tasks filling surveys downloading apps phone tha immediatly removed registering website confirming e mail earned ove process spent real money game wanted completeing tasks earn guns equipment wanted finally talk dev team regular updates bug fixes new features added game feels like paying development game new areas new animals hunt recently addition hunting dogs lets know dev team working hard bring new exciting features game people turned money dropped game concern comes best hunting games played hope change pricing model day willing pay amazing features game right given quality edit mention price able hunt animals low opinion month cost month pump shotgun allow hunt literallly animal game feel like missions buy single shot shotgun unpaid currency pay month membership month able hunt single animal game gives unlimited ammo hunt want time wo nt problem mind win competitions paid currency difficult rank people problem game hours game explain leave initial thehunter browser open steam counts game billion hours week leave open leave browser open nearly time buddies gf play latest news updated game think sketchy hours game literallyn leave main browser open

296,2949,2952,War Thunder,"Graphics are great but if you want to see the enemy Tanks you can just use low settings and all the foliage is removed. This game is so free they incorporated a setting that would get you perma banned in other Tank or FPS games. The Tank maps are some of the worst I have seen in a game, with so many years they have not a single good map and the Assault maps are the worst by far. Also on the Assault map the enemy Bot Tanks seem to have little problem pulling of shots while driving from almost a kilometer away with rank 1-2 Tanks.Low Rank/Non upgraded Tanks also have this unrealistic thing that they can't turn unless going forward or reversing, which creates frustrating situations.The grind is there, for what ever reason I need to grind out 6 Tanks before I can buy a next rankTank, its the law?

304,17433,17438,EverQuest II,"I purchased this game back and 2008 and only played the 30 day free trial but didnt feel like it was worth the subscription fee at the time as I probably didnt put enough time into. When everquest 2 extended came out I downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as I just couldnt get into it.Finally I decided to play it again now that it was Free to Play. Fist I downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what I was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. When I noticed it was on steam I reinstalled it on here and Iv been playing non stop eversince. One of the huge perks I found as I was playing was I had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, 500 Station Cash I didnt know I had and tons and tons of other bonuses I had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on 08. This really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what I could do in the game. Especially with housing.Graphics:This is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. Its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps1 game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. It all just rolls out to look so good for its age. There are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec. In some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. Im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. Its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.Gameplay:Iv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. I dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as I did with this game; despite me not giving it the chance in the first place. Im still not even at the level cap of 95... Wait I read they raised it to 100 hahaha. Thats pretty awesome in itself to me because it means i still have a ton of content to buzz through plus the latest expansion pack. So far as of this review Im level 54 and I dont even really feel the game is a grind. It just leaves me wanting to play more.The questing type for the most part is standard kill so and so or get me this many of this thing but it does thow in some quests where unique items are given to you and that item is used to summon a boss for instance or special goggles to help you find clues. Even though it has so many of the standard quests I actually prefer them over the other quests wheree the special items are required. There usually less tetius and go quicker and this results in faster xp and gold and sick♥♥♥♥♥quest item rewards. This being said I still love the bit of variety it does have and it keeps me wanting more. This game has made me fall in love with running dungeons. In the Guildwars games dungeons were always pretty fun with friends or a good group but they generally require you to wait around for a group or use there sick♥♥♥♥♥dungeon finder to get a group together. This is all well and sweet and pretty flawless for guildwars 2 but I like how I can freely run a dungeon alone or with a group here in everquest 2. It just depends on your level and ability. Theres the flipside to that. You can also run the dungeons with people when your at a lower level or whatever so that option is obviously still there I guess the problem with it is though, is finding a group of people around who want to help you and not just clear the whole place out a few seconds before you. I tuely feel that there dungeon matchmaking needs to be improved because I find it confusing as♥♥♥♥♥♥or not very functional at the time. It would be amazing if they incorperated a mega server type idea like Guildwars 2 as that solution in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. I swear if Everquest 2 and Guildwars 2 had some awesome♥♥♥♥♥sex, that would be my dream game born.The game is free to play and is probably one of the most honest free to play games I looked into for the most part. Although most f2p models are coming around. It never forces you to purchase anything and you honestly have little of a need to spend a dime. I however got sucked in a bit but paying to research some skills faster or upgrade them to the Master Tier. I also bought some cool white armor skins which you obvously dont need. Iv also spent some station cash for instant repairs of my armor because I didnt feel like traveling back to town but repair men are all over and not to hard to find for the most part. I also sub'd last month and this month so I could adjust my alternate experience slider to give me more adventure xp for a few months but this was just something I wanted to test and it is a nice added feature but the free 50 percent option is still more the viable and works behind the scenes so you dont even need to think about it. Being at 50 percent Adventure experince also didnt feel like a grind when I was playing free, it just felt standard and A nice shinny option that was there if I ever chose to pay to use it. My best purchase so far though that most people may want to concider adding is the Mercinaries pack which allows you to hire an AI companion that helps you in battle. Not only does it make leveling a little faster before level 50 it also makes it alot faster and combat will be alot easier with a merc, escpecally when when fighting mobs of heroic characters. I chose to purchase this extra fairly early on in the game with my real world cash as the higher the level you are in the game the more ingame gold he will cost to hire. Buying this pack also allows you to summon tour merc no matter where you are. I dont use him a ton unless im running a dungeon alone so he is not to pricey for my in game budget but it is something that I sort of felt like I was missing before I purchased the addon. This just might be me though. Playing the game without a merc is entirely doable you just might need to find a buddy instead and be a little social or if you have the addon find some buddies and bring mercs too.♥♥♥♥♥♥will hit the roof im assuming.I guess I was a little slow in the head because I didnt find the storyline quests in my log until my early 20s I think. Man I was jacked when I found these though. They gave me more to shoot for. A reason to play and read these quests. I was having a ton of fun just running sidequests and getting the rewards and when I found the storyline quests and they even better loot they offered I got pulled in more and it gave me all new reason to keep playing. One of the story missions game me a Raptor like mount for a reward. I was pretty pumped about that even though I already bought a horse. The raptor was slow though and had the ability to almost jump and glide. The gliding was cool but I was like ♥♥♥♥ this things way to slow so i never used it. Now however im in higher level areas which require more climbing or going around mountains. While I swapped to my raptor and there was no more going around big long hills I could now set my tracker to where the mobs were and jump right over the big cliffs until I got there. Its been saving me a ton of time. Now im just in the middle of the content and im still having a ton of fun.Daily achievments are also pretty fun and quite easy to get. Completing 2 will give you loyalty tokens that you actually want to spend. Now I have 33 token and im saving up for a wild ♥♥♥♥ing mansion for 65 or something. Its worth it and easy to collect.

308,14880,14885,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewThe game used to be good. Trust me, you don't want to play. I've been keeping up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relating to it, only because I'm too lazy to unfollow them on Facebook. The patches seem to be following the pattern I saw in the days leading up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago. I've noticed their desperate attempts to add band-aid ""features"" and ""balances"" that are meant to appease their ""fans"" and keep them around and have them pay 2 win. The DLCs aren't worth their cost at all, $35 dollars for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flyer that won't last 5 seconds in a match? LMAO!! and $50 for premium? WTF?!?!? At most its worth $10! AT MOST!I've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. And then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of Hell itself. How? idk. Supposedly, at some point, Freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. Since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. The crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. Then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. Premium was never worth the price. In the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. As a newbie back then, I can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me 6 months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. After a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. And of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than 3 colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. And after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. But thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get 1 of that item, let alone the 3 or 4 you'd need for it to be viable. And by that time, the devs would have initiated at least 4000 different metas. In the early days, everything was relatively balanced. Of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. After a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). So, they did some quick patches to ""fix that."" R.I.P. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. While that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. There were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). So, slap some tier 2 armor on, then slap some tier 7 guns on, go rek the tier 4 people, ggez. But tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. Then came the flak cannons, RIP flyers of all kinds. Then came rockets, RIP everything. Then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (I forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. Then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. Then came the shotguns. Then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. After that I left, no surprise really. I'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since I left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than I think (which is saying something, cause I think its a ♥♥♥♥ ton). There's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. Its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. You want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? Even THE most popular Robocraft Youtuber, Rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. Rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. Really the only remaining popular Robocraft Youtubers are Gromek999 and Jac733. I can only assume that they are paid by Freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, I don't know how anyone could make a positive video on Robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. They could pay me $10mil a video and I still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

313,14865,14870,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewWall of Text inbound:Great game. Amazing game. I love this game to pieces.  At least I used to. The game was awesome up until recently. Than crates arrived. Actually I shouldn't blame one update I suppose. If I were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, I'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the CRF. This feature, which I'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within Robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. The CRF allowed for the rapid deployment of ""OP"" bots or rather exploitative builds. I'm going to use the ""tesseract"" as an example. While not a huge issue on its own, it is the way FreeJam went about ""resolving"" this issue that made matters worse. To any ""veteran"" of the game that had some knowledge of the problem,  the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. A more ""complex"" fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. Sadly, FreeJam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1,but 3 (now 2, but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. While the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. This isn't a review whining about badly balanced AA though, so onto the next nail. Shortly after this fiasco, FJ introduced ""Epic Loot"". A system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. Alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins 9 times out of 10. Instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to ""test their luck"" with crates. Crates that logically fail to reward a player. Common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. This makes sense. The crates FJ has forced upon us do not follow such logic. High tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. This is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, period. There's also the complaint regarding the premium row ""flaunting"" items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. Moving on to the big one. A lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. If every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. As simple as this problem is, it is so bad in FJ's case.  The simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for  angry customers to vent. Why? No devs will respond, with exception of Drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :3). The devs that have a proper power over the games development use Twitter instead of their own forums. It's dumb. Anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, I'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. So Tl;Dr:Pros:1. Builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. 2. Not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. Cons:1. Devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised 2. Balance weapons? What are those? 3. Exploit/meta builds everywhere. Creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to FJ. 4. Hope you enjoy gambling. ======================I really like this game. But sadly, I can't recommend it to anyone because for 1.

315,583,585,WARMODE,"Early Access Review  Title WARMODE   Developer WARTEAM   Publisher WARTEAM  Release 25 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price Free-to-play  Rating 5/10 The game.WARMODE is a FPS about the confrontation of two sides, represented by the government military and the armed hirelings.Gameplay.An interesting game, still in early-alpha. Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points.

318,13851,13855,Dreadnought,"Don't have anything good to say for it so I'll say something about Fractured Space (https://store.steampowered.com/app/310380/Fractured_Space/) instead. Unlike Dreadnought,  Fractured Space is a solid space MOBA. Is easy to get into. It's balanced. Intuitive controls. The microtransaction model is pretty much obsolete (which is good for us) as getting ships and modding is very easy, premium currency will also be given to you on many occasions like inside lootboxes (no you don't need a key to open them) that you get from completing quests or straight up completing a quest for em. The ammounts you get are good. The game has regular events and content additions. Controls are intuitive. It's moderately more fast paced which leaves you more room to correct yourself if you make mistakes as well as make more mistakes and just use lots of abilities and maneuvers in a shorter time than it is in Dreadnought. Graphics don't suck The ship modifiers are presented in a form of  a list of crew members for each prophiciency. Whom are each voiced and have various personalities talking to you in battle. Kind of like Dreadnought but good. Furthermore augmentations can be assigned to each one. Taking shots and abilities to the face as well as firing and casting affects your ship directly, you'll be thrown around.You know? Zero grav and physics, it's fun. Allows for extra tactics. Everything Dreadnought has, Fractured Space has more and better._______________________________________________________________I enjoyed Dreadnought in the beta, for the first 10 minutes. This time at launch I had zero enjoyment.The menu is horrid. You can remap the controls but they're obnoxious to begin with.Uses the grindy progression/microtransaction model from World of Tanks, War Thunder, Heroes & Generals.. There's virtually no feedback, you could be getting shot in the back and never notice it. You'll often find yourself simply trying to manage and monitor your ammo, energy, health etc  as they burn out fast, instead of making decisions in battle. It feels more like fast paced management mini-game, not ""Action"" which one of the tags states.The most underwhelming launch of a game in a while.YAGER I still love you for Spec Ops tho.I know it looks like I bashed on Dreadnought but the differences are quite prominent right now. Both are free, try em. I hope I make you discover what you were looking for in this game but didn't get. Perhaps something completely different but still compelling.

341,10762,10766,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewA very fun CCG with mechanics in line with Magic (5 colors of mana, mana cards have to be drawn, defender chooses blockers, instant cast spells usable on opponent's turn, etc). The initial intro with the starter decks is a little tedious, but once you get past that the game is shockingly fair for a free to play game.For single player content, you have the Gauntlet and the Forge. The Gauntlet is free and pits your constructed deck against up to 7 AI in a row (one loss and you start over) for progressively better rewards (gold, cards, card packs if you win all 7). The Forge lets you draft cards to play 7 games against the AI and ends if you lose twice. You keep ALL the cards you draft and can also win 3-4 card packs and a chunk of gold (buy in is 2.5 packs worth of gold), making this a great way to build your collection while learning the game.Multiplayer currently has Ranked and Draft, with each ranked win giving gold / cards (sometimes a pack with a lucky roll) and Draft is like the Forge on steroids, with you drafting (and keeping!) a larger number of cards to create your deck.I've been collecting cards so fast I felt obligated to send some money the dev's way, which is a hell of a contrast from many other games in this genre.",1, early access reviewa fun ccg mechanics line magic colors mana mana cards drawn defender chooses blockers instant cast spells usable opponent turn etc initial intro starter decks little tedious past game shockingly fair free play game single player content gauntlet forge gauntlet free pits constructed deck ai row loss start progressively better rewards gold cards card packs win forge lets draft cards play games ai ends lose twice cards draft win card packs chunk gold buy packs worth gold making great way build collection learning game multiplayer currently ranked draft ranked win giving gold cards pack lucky roll draft like forge steroids drafting keeping larger number cards create deck collecting cards fast felt obligated send money dev way hell contrast games genre

I remember picking this game up and saying, ""Hey, this looks sweet."" And it was! Germany and America dueling it out. Skirmishes was the best and both teams seemed to take turns winning wars. Simply because they both had good, experienced Generals/Officers.So what happened? Well the Soviet Union came in. And because the CoD generation of gamers exists, they went to the Soviets because of their stronkness. And so that team got flooded and everyone whined that they weren't good enough.Right off the bat, they had buffed spawn tickets and it seemed like they had good equipment. They needed this because it saved their lives. Then it took a dark turn. They lose every war in last place but win most of the skirmishes because of some stupid HP system and some really stupid OP weapons.Another major issue: TanksFirst off, I'd like to say that when you have a machine gun in the game cost just as much as a Tiger I, you've got issues.

So objectives just get traded until someone, eight hours later, wins.Tanks also get killed for staying still so it's a lose/lose situation if you pick that career option.Oh and it doesn't make a difference if you are driving in a Tiger II or an M4 Sherman, your♥♥♥♥♥is molasses as Sheriff Buford T. Justice would say.Planes are an absolute joke to fly. I can't seem to do it and others can. Fly Germany if you want wings on your chest I guess? I don't know. The P-38 seems like a stupid option for an aircraft. The P-51 and P-47 were more used than the P-38 for the game's intended purpose so why is this mediocre aircraft there?Paratrooper is the best career hands down. You can join the fight anywhere your plane flies and you get that sweet sweet M1A1 Carbine. Sniper's are OP but I guess that's their role so I don't know. OHK rifles, that ones the snipers get, are realistic but they seem limited to the bolt-action rifles. Most of which fire the same round as their ""starter rifle"" counter parts for brand new players. And these starter rifles take two or three shots to kill someone at medium to close range. So not realistic then.Infantry is where you'll get the most out of the game. The most weapons and vehicles for all purposes. Before AT mines were nerfed I would destroy two Tiger's in every life I had. Just place the mine below it's♥♥♥♥♥ run away, shoot the mine. And the whole thing just blew up. The most fun I had.The Soviets get no MG on their starter utility car/vehicle. So they are at a supreme disadvantage going against level 1 American or German motorized infantry.Currently, this game is turning to garbage update after update. People don't cooperate with teams at all. They just go out to score some Kills because....K/D's are more important.The playerbase is shrinking and no new players are coming because all of the good reviews are in the negative. Some good effort was poured into this game but ultimately, the developers didn't listen to the community.

347,14720,14725,Robocraft,"This is my first negative review for a game ever, and it hurts me to do so on this game but the dissapointment is too much - FREEJAM... What a shame - PLEASE fix your terrible new tiering system out, you completely killed robocraft with it. Until then, I have very little motivation to play. I have played with friends since first release, LOVED IT. Got over T10+, stopped for a while and we said to each other that ""we can't wait to play it in a while and see it grow and mature""... 1 year later, we try it again updated, excited to show additional friends too... but wait, it's not Robocraft anymore - it's truly Robocrap. The spirit of classically, easily and understandably levelling up (to all types of end-users) has died... you could even say this pretty much isn't even a proper objective-based level-up game anymore, now it's just some weird kind of open-world-free-for-all-matchmaking-CHAOS that is really frustrating and just doesn't make sense.Robocraft is now literally a sinking ship - soon on it's way to 'Mixed' reviews on Steam. This game could have been a timeless classic, and it still can be. Would love to delete this review and leave a recommended one, make it happen. I'll be watching carefully, and honestly if it's not fixed soon I'll be very sad to see this once-a-great-game be uninstalled from my library.*EDIT/UPDATE 1* - For people who say I'm hating, I'm not, I still love the game and I'm actually still playing it, if you haven't played the game since it's initial release you won't understand. Trust me, if you played the pre-updated versions you would say, “why did they ever change it?!” ... I just cannot recommend Robocraft anymore - yes it WAS a fantastic game, but anyone can make any robot now and the matchmaking will 90% of the time put you in an extremely unfair game - the tiering system is completely messed up making the whole aim of the game pointless... the achingly painful feeling of spending hours on building an awesome robot only to find it is put into games with MUCH more powerful robots is depressing, confusing and just pure torture :(*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (29/09/2015) - I was just playing Robocraft all last night, woke up this morning and wow... just WOW - FREEJAM what are you guys even doing?! A few days ago I made this review and it made it to the steam store page and I hoped maybe you guys would feel my outrage, but nope, you go and add even more ridiculous updates. In the last update you made it so that only high level robots can do TDM, a week later, without any word of warning again, without letting the community know what your doing you switch the whole thing around for a week? and your excuse is, ""so we can make more games available for everyone""... :| :| :| LOL HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! At least come up with better excuses. Seriously, let us know more about what your doing and working on, you should be serving your consumers, making votes and poll's, making us feel part of the development, instead you don't listen to suggestions and complaints and you act like Gods who use their consumers as lab rats. I'm not even playing this week because of today's update. You know, I didn't even know who you guys were until your over-tampering with the game, your presence in the game makes me feel nauseous and I had to find out who was causing it, how sad is that? I should be searching you guys up because of how awesome you guys are as developers, and yes you guys were good initally, but your test of integrity failed badly. How can you not see your ruining the game? It's like you guys sweat on your monitors so much that you can't see your screens anymore. Take a break, have a shower and clean it all up.Sorry if I seem harsh xD I'm just ranting on, BUT STILL, the truth is always harsh. :) Anyway just remember I'm willing to forgive and forget and venerate you guys as one of the best indie game developers ever for making the awesome game that is Robocraft if you just sort out all these unnecessary updates, kthnxbye :D (Y)*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (02/04/2018) - I just realised I predicted years ago that Robocraft would go down to ""Mixed reviews"" status on Steam and I checked back today and it is a solid Mixed. I installed the game again to see if there were any improvements and oh... my.... there are no words to desribe how bad and messed up the game has become. I've never seen any other game become this ruined before! I would predict that this game would go to ""Mostly negative"" however all the current players probably never played the original Robocraft.

349,3840,3843,Team Fortress 2,"This game is fascinating. I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked♥♥♥♥♥ so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking ""It can't be that bad"".After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse.The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the ""Meet the"" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, ""15 kills, 10 deaths"" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my♥♥♥♥♥♥to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive.My point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!!! (I still recommend it, though.

It has,-Good Graphics-Smooth Gameplay-Free-And thats all i got to say.The ""That someone took a♥♥♥♥♥♥on"" part is obviously the bad part which i would say is,-For a game which you can puck multiple sides, it is very one-sided, I say this becauseOne side (not naming which) has weaponry that is 10x stronger than othersThe playerbase is very one sided too. (But what can you expect from a game that has the USA as a choice of side)-The battles are very fair at the start of a match, but whoever wins that first charge pretty much wins the entire game and makes it s hellhole for the other team(s) (And may i note that the battles can range from 30M to 2H?)Now i will note some things which are neither bad or good, but may affect your stance of the game -A bit grindy, It will take you a LONG time to get somewhere, i had to fight somewhere close to 7 battles for rank 2? And like i said a battle can be from 30M to 2H.-Battles are long, some people enjoy long hard fights but some people enjoy shorter, 5 minutes fights that you can get alot of kills in.-The game is a hellhole for new players, After you rach acertain amount of silver you can choose a career.

369,3922,3925,Team Fortress 2,"Been playing this game since 2010, i've met some interesting and awsome people on this FPS game on some community servers. The 9 classes are psychotic mercs but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from SFM videos and the TF2 comics. The many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, cosmetics. It gives you many different loadouts and play styles. You could even add mods for more playability. There are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the Steam Community market.But I enjoy the community servers and different game modes Payload, Payload Race, SD Doomsday, Pass time, Versus Saxton hale, Randomizer, x10, CTF, koth, Control Point, mann vs machine, surf, trade servers, mann power, Halloween mode maps, and much more. And don't forget now there is competitive and casual play as well, if your interested.There is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs, surfing, and rocket/sticky/sentry jumping.Although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible I disagree. Sure it has some problems but it has a very good Community with big events like Tip of the Hats. As i said before the TF2 characters are more interesting and have a very crazy but also lovable personality and they interact with each other in game.",1, playing game met interesting awsome people fps game community servers classes psychotic mercs good way interesting stories sfm videos comics different weapons makes good changes pace strats course cosmetics gives different loadouts play styles add mods playability micro transactions need buy mann co store need premium save metal stock refined metal trade buy items cheaper price steam community market enjoy community servers different game modes payload payload race sd doomsday pass time versus saxton hale randomizer ctf koth control point mann vs machine surf trade servers mann power halloween mode maps forget competitive casual play interested skill ceiling game keeps practicing specific classes play steep learning curb teqniques like stair stabs surfing rocket sticky sentry jumping people game dead right terrible disagree sure problems good community big events like tip hats said characters interesting crazy lovable personality interact game

371,6867,6871,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThe Good:Multiple soldier classes to choose from, meaning multiple play styles to utilize and select from.Separate resources for soldiers and assault teams.The ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skills to specialize them how you wish.The ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicles by investing time and experience into the previous levels.The ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat, such as faster reloading, reduced damage taken, and carrying more ammunition.Three nations to choose from, allowing different gear between factions with few exceptions.Each soldier can earn more for fighting based on their rank, providing an incentive to continue to improve and rank up.The ability to give a General's gear to other soldiers of the same faction, once said soldier becomes a General.The Bad:Each soldier starts with no experience, base gear, and must play through the same tutorial to start earning credits in battles just by playing.Experience gain is painfully slow, with gains and rewards becoming more insignificant over time until they start becoming not only more miniscule, but more time-consuming as well.Each experience tree not only unlocks different perks, but different items, and do not intersect, often holding new items in the middle or later stages of the trees.Each nation unlocks different things in different orders, meaning some nations will be able to unlock better equipment at different points, such as tanks.At least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the Generals part of the game, unless you purchase a General or high-ranked soldier using real-world cashAll weapons, vehicles, classes and assault teams can be purchased using real-world currency. The only exception is ribbon levels and perks, which can be unlocked faster using boosters or a premium accountEach player is thrust into matches with high-level players randomly upon reaching rank 3 with one soldier, meaning they often face off against vastly superior enemies very early on.Even the “balanced” matches are not balanced, because soldier numbers on each faction in battle can be uneven to an extent.All three factions are treated as separate entities, making a game based off of the second World War seem more like a free-for-all game.Spawn points can be easily “camped” by enemy players using tanks, making for a highly dissatisfying battle.Vehicles can be spawned sideways, upside-down, or in the immediate line of fire, making high-action points a nightmare to use, especially when said points are the only remaining ones to spawn from.Weapons can be modified to allow for instant one-shot capabilities, no matter where the victim is hit.Frame rate and connectivity is a huge issue, especially during high activity in small areas.Weapons can be modified to allow for extreme fire rates, making it nigh-impossible to react before one is killed.Allied players are able to repeatedly kill their own teams with little to no recourse noted as of yet, other than a minor loss of experience.Gaining any type of currency is slow and tedious, on top of the high cost of modified and specific gear.Players can join battles late and end up earning absolutely no reward for participation, even if they play a significant role in the battle.Players can buy the ability to equip two perks, a fourth weapon, and gain a boost to resources and experience earned through a premium account.Certain perks either do not seem to work right or are considered overpowered, such as the ability to remove the “kill camera”, which is actually the ability to see where you were killed from.Players can enter matches in which they will be forced to fight against tank players, even if their team have none, and oftentimes cannot do anything about it other than be crushed. This happens even in the “balanced” game modes.In-game “Wars” last an average of 2-3 days, requiring players to select their server and faction all over again every time one ends, even if they themselves did not participate.Paratroopers cannot jump out of a drop plane that is currently plummeting without incurring a suicide penalty, meaning whomever shot down the plane gets a free reward for killing them. [EDIT: You might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit, but you still die instantly once it's started to plummet.]Fighter planes have little to no variety, and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls.Players earn a miniscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing, and would need to play one battle every day for 294 days in order to purchase the lowest-ranked War Bond in the shop, which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to 310 days' worth of first-battle bonuses over half a year. Meanwhile, the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of 350 days' worth costs under $8 USD.For whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in Early Release, still, please note that this is a personal opinion and an Early Release review, on top of that, meaning that as more patches are added, this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time. As it stands, though, I cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highly-experienced or skilled player, but also the one who throws money at it.And yes, I did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point.",0, early access reviewthe good multiple soldier classes choose meaning multiple play styles utilize select separate resources soldiers assault teams ability rank soldier individual weapon skills specialize wish ability unlock powerful gear vehicles investing time experience previous levels ability unlock choose perk soldier combat faster reloading reduced damage taken carrying ammunition nations choose allowing different gear factions exceptions soldier earn fighting based rank providing incentive continue improve rank ability general gear soldiers faction said soldier general bad soldier starts experience base gear play tutorial start earning credits battles playing experience gain painfully slow gains rewards insignificant time start miniscule time consuming experience tree unlocks different perks different items intersect holding new items middle later stages trees nation unlocks different things different orders meaning nations able unlock better equipment different points tanks soldier reach rank field officer participate generals game purchase general high ranked soldier real world cashall weapons vehicles classes assault teams purchased real world currency exception ribbon levels perks unlocked faster boosters premium accounteach player thrust matches high level players randomly reaching rank soldier meaning face vastly superior enemies early balanced matches balanced soldier numbers faction battle uneven extent factions treated separate entities making game based second world war like free game spawn points easily camped enemy players tanks making highly dissatisfying battle vehicles spawned sideways upside immediate line fire making high action points nightmare use especially said points remaining ones spawn weapons modified allow instant shot capabilities matter victim hit frame rate connectivity huge issue especially high activity small areas weapons modified allow extreme fire rates making nigh impossible react killed allied players able repeatedly kill teams little recourse noted minor loss experience gaining type currency slow tedious high cost modified specific gear players join battles late end earning absolutely reward participation play significant role battle players buy ability equip perks fourth weapon gain boost resources experience earned premium account certain perks work right considered overpowered ability remove kill camera actually ability killed players enter matches forced fight tank players team oftentimes crushed happens balanced game modes game wars average days requiring players select server faction time ends participate paratroopers jump drop plane currently plummeting incurring suicide penalty meaning whomever shot plane gets free reward killing edit occur suicide penalty credit die instantly started planes little variety built entirely joystick users controls players earn miniscule gold funds day playing need play battle day days order purchase lowest ranked war bond shop rewards total equivalent days worth battle bonuses half year lowest gold available equivalent days worth costs whomever considers unfair review game considered early release note personal opinion early release review meaning patches added review shall edited reconsidered time stands recommend game reasons highly primed detriment new skilled players benefit highly experienced skilled player throws money yes calculate equivalency currency time needed reach point
372,14390,14395,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewBasically Robocraft is quite a nice game but it really has some issues. Now there are gonna be enough reviews with pros and cons and the likes so let me make this short.There are only 2 reasons this game gets a no from me currently.1. There used to be a time were Rail Helis were, niche, hard to properly create and play but they were fun, and really useful in the right hands too. Your rails were rather unprecise due to the bobbing up and down of the rotor blades, meaning in order to aim properly you had to act against the bob, adding an additional layer of skill to actually play a competitive Rail Heli. Even then you traded some of your accuracy for mobility. Now though, in a real fight you can expect lots of freak misfires that just hit the ground 20 meter away from were the red dot was.(Speaking of which, what the frick do I need a red dot for if it isn't related to the spot I'll be hitting at all? I already have a reticule.)To make this issue weirder, I can't recreate this problem in the training mode at all. 1500ft and I still get 5 out of 6 shots on a target more than half a map away, all while moving up/down AND across the map. Maybe they're caused by being damaged? I don't know, but it's annoying, and the accuracy loss during fights is WAY too big.I still can play my Rail Heli that used to kick♥♥♥♥♥halfway decently, but the constant freak misfires which are not directly my fault AND can't be prevented by anything aside from getting another bot type, are taking a lot of fun out of the game. It just won't feel right. And yeah, that as an airborne player is still a larger issue than flak cannons or the likes to me.2. ""The scores of the winning team have been doubled"" aka ""Carried Scrublord > Exceptional Player on losing team""If just they'd change those 2 things this game would get a full recommendation from me. And I'd sink a lot more time into this game too. As long as those are there... thanks, but no thanks.Edit: 21.06.2016There's a lot of nice new features, like smart weapons and stuff. It's actually quite nice. Aside maybe from whiner acommodation aka flak.And I really want to get hyped again for this game but my personal playing niche has been completely killed off, and since it's still as dead as it gets my review stays negative.",0, early access reviewbasically robocraft nice game issues gon na reviews pros cons likes let short reasons game gets time rail helis niche hard properly create play fun useful right hands rails unprecise bobbing rotor blades meaning order aim properly act bob adding additional layer skill actually play competitive rail heli traded accuracy mobility real fight expect lots freak misfires hit ground meter away red dot frick need red dot related spot hitting issue weirder recreate problem training mode ft shots target half map away moving map maybe caused damaged know annoying accuracy loss fights way big play rail heli kick halfway decently constant freak misfires directly fault prevented aside getting bot type taking lot fun game wo feel right yeah airborne player larger issue flak cannons likes scores winning team doubled aka carried scrublord exceptional player losing change things game recommendation sink lot time game long thanks thanks edit lot nice new features like smart weapons stuff actually nice aside maybe whiner acommodation aka flak want hyped game personal playing niche completely killed dead gets review stays negative

378,2185,2188,Path of Exile,"-Devs, although they seem to be great and connect to the community, only really interface thorugh reddit and don't seem to address problems properly imo,-As mentioned in other reviews, this game turns into an oligopoly simulator where most players farm  to try adn get enough currency to play whatever build they want or simply flip currency to get there several times faster. The fact that there is entirely no deterministic farming means that trading is almost necessary for a lot of players given their playtime and as such multiplayer interactions are necessary.-Since multiplayer interaction is required, a mention to the fact that trading relies entirely on an external 3rd party website seems relevant. GGG makes no effort in fxing this issue and the in-game trade chat is an aberration of scammers and bots.-Balance changes are made around mostly the top players, i.e streamers and nolifers, meaning that the for the vast majority of the playerbase, many things are not possible at all, which is perfectly reasonable given the ARPG genre of the game. However, said balance changes are often nonsensical and utterly brainless: for instance blatantly overpowered uniques introduced to the game, most of existing uniques being useless garbage, nerfing the FOTM build every league. An extreme case that shows how out of touch the balance team at GGG is is the state of melee in the game: they don't even have the basic understanding that what makes melee skills relatively unviable, which is the mechanics. instead, they give a few % more modifier on the damage as if that will change anything. Ranged and spellcasters deal both more damage/have more aoe and are safer to play due to several reasons such as being closer to CI and also not having to be in melee range of mobs but they don't seem to understand thsi at all.-There is a lot of false diversity in this game. Given how difficult it is to produce a truly original build that really works, it is basically recommended to follow some build guide. When you consider all these build guides, they all share may similarities within given archetyoes, CWDT IC, same skill tree give or take a few nodes with different active skill gems: even the support gems are usually  the same, especially for melee skills. Whilst many active skill gems exist, many of them either have the same mechanics or are simply not used.-Crafting is also equally falsely diverse (not considering the new essence league which is not part of the core game) givem that it consists of spamming orbs of fusings to get a 6-link or spamming chaos with the occasional exalt slam. -The fact that the game is still treated as a public beta and bugs, although they might be fixed reasonably quickly, are not accounted for in terms of previosu playerHC lost characters worries me given that the game has existed for such a long period of time. In addition, almost every recent league launch has been horrendous and problem-ridden, yet it is still described by the GGG team as ""having gone well"" with no mention at all of the huge problems that happened, especially given the competitive nature of the game and the very staggered starts that different people encountered on the ladder to 100.-Many problems still exist in the game despite general engine improvements, e.g. lag from rain and ground effects, which have persisted since their introduction, and the game has only just come relatively close to other games of similar fame in terms of performance.In conclusion, I would not recommend this game given how slow the early game is for new players and how dire the current state of the game is.Addendum: After the passing of a few more ""leagues"", repeated bad design and balance issues and a failulre to understand at it's basis what a game of this genre is meant to achieve, probably due to the void of other games in the arpg genre, I have reached the point where I no longer expect anything from Grinding Gear Games: the leagues become sloppier and sloppier with little to no end game content to even look forward to.There is no real skills rebalance and the devs obviously don't even playtest their own content for balance: this is evident from their delegation of the balancing to the reddit community, especially notable popular streamers of the game, and it is really unforgiveable for a company of their size to be so inept at anything except PR and occasionally art.The release of multiple ""loot boxes"" for visual microtransactions is visibly becoming worse and worse, with the latest complete armour set requiring on average $210 with huge variance due to dupilcates. I would not recommend anyone purchase anything with money in this game unless they agree with most of GGG's design philosophies.",0, great connect community interface thorugh reddit address problems properly mentioned reviews game turns oligopoly simulator players farm try adn currency play build want simply flip currency times faster fact entirely deterministic farming means trading necessary lot players given playtime multiplayer interactions multiplayer interaction required mention fact trading relies entirely external party website relevant ggg makes effort fxing issue game trade chat aberration scammers changes players streamers nolifers meaning vast majority playerbase things possible perfectly reasonable given arpg genre game said balance changes nonsensical utterly brainless instance blatantly overpowered uniques introduced game existing uniques useless garbage nerfing fotm build league extreme case shows touch balance team ggg state melee game basic understanding makes melee skills relatively unviable mechanics instead modifier damage change ranged spellcasters deal damage aoe safer play reasons closer ci having melee range mobs understand thsi lot false diversity game given difficult produce truly original build works basically recommended follow build guide consider build guides share similarities given archetyoes cwdt ic skill tree nodes different active skill gems support gems usually especially melee skills whilst active skill gems exist mechanics simply equally falsely diverse considering new essence league core game givem consists spamming orbs fusings link spamming chaos occasional exalt slam fact game treated public beta bugs fixed reasonably quickly accounted terms previosu playerhc lost characters worries given game existed long period time addition recent league launch horrendous problem ridden described ggg team having gone mention huge problems happened especially given competitive nature game staggered starts different people encountered ladder problems exist game despite general engine improvements lag rain ground effects persisted introduction game come relatively close games similar fame terms performance conclusion recommend game given slow early game new players dire current state game addendum passing leagues repeated bad design balance issues failulre understand basis game genre meant achieve probably void games arpg genre reached point longer expect grinding gear games leagues sloppier sloppier little end game content look forward real skills rebalance devs obviously playtest content balance evident delegation balancing reddit community especially notable popular streamers game unforgiveable company size inept pr occasionally art release multiple loot boxes visual microtransactions visibly worse worse latest complete armour set requiring average huge variance dupilcates recommend purchase money game agree ggg design philosophies

385,11901,11905,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewBless online looks incredible at first glance, but like a new car bought off craigs list the problems quickly come into view.   The engine simply doesnt work, FPS drops are consistent even on a pc that can run BDO on 60 fps consistently, the UI freezes your computer consistently for small spurts for no reason, the windshields literally 5 inches from your face and trying to adjust it simply launches it into the stratosphere, and finally the game itself freezes like its going to win something.  Now this can be forgiven as the game is in early access and as such can easily be fixed.  Lack of optimization is not neccessarily a bad thing and shouldnt affect ones purchase, however with this game having been released previously it doesnt really scream GOOD THINGS at you while you play.Bless online has some of the easiest leveling in the game, which is one of the only things I am pleasantly surprised by.  Most games with enchanting systems like bless have long slogs of leveling and enchanting to keep people around for years (im looking at you BDO) simply because they lack content.  Bless seems to have corrected this issue.  It is altogether possible to hit level 30 in around 10-14 hours while running dungeons and while it is boring it isnt neccessarily difficult.  The problem with this is that the game is so boring you may never want to find out what combat or pvp is present at endgame and if you are lucky enough to not crash every 30 minutes you might even get that chance.TLDR:  Bless offline is a brilliant tool to train patience with, if you enjoy staring at a login screen for hours and crashing constantly give it a try.

386,3159,3162,War Thunder,"Now personally i would rate is a yes, and i really want to give it that thumbs up, because the game is really well done, and I dont mind a good grind. flying some of the planes and driving some of the tanks that youve worked for is really fun and i enjoy the game. The only reason i dont recomend the game is because of something that the game has no real control over. The Community.The community that the game has with it is extreamly toxic, espcially if you just want to destress and have a fun time. With aviation specificly, i feel that seal clubbing happens, atleast as this reveiw is written, very common. I back this up with flying a plane can be easy, but pulling off some of the manuevers that are rather hard, even by todays pilots, is not something a first time pilot would know of, or even complete without some practice. To further back this up, I've ran into a lot of pilots who have DAYS recorded just playing fighters or attack planes, what is fine and all, but vs noobies... its like having stealing from a baby. The game rewards players, both tankers and pilots in a way for seal clubbing by letting them use the XP they gained to further the tank/plane that they are currently reseaching, but tanks can only research tanks and planes, planes, respectivly.I personally dont think i will stop playing the game after this reveiw, i really do like playing the game, its just if your looking at getting the game, know that some tanks and planes are sometimes put into games a teir ahead, or behind of what its ment to be, what is good if you are flying a C .50 with a BR rating just slightly under 2 at 1.7 (i want to say) and your facing biplanes with a BR rating of a flat 1.0 with rather flimy struts. Also know that you will be doing a lot of grinding for that plane or tank that you want to play, but like mentioned earlier, you dont have to buy the next tank to keep progessing down a line, or getting a better verient of plane.I think the game would improve more if instead of sprinkling in some planes and tanks here and there, and adding a new teir (what i have no XP and wont for a long time with), maybe increase the variety of planes, and add tanks (if they historicly had them) to the italian line. Another thing that i think might me nice, would be to group people up by if they are just starting a nation, and only have the starter tanks/planes. just so its more of a learning enviornment. I dont really know how to make the community less toxic though... maybe punish freindly fire or something, i cant suggest anything really, its more or a person thing, not a game mechanic thing...If you still want to give war thunder a try, i highly recomend trying it out, just be warry of things,-Wolftron",0, personally rate yes want thumbs game nt mind good grind flying planes driving tanks ve worked fun enjoy game reason nt recomend game game real control community community game extreamly toxic espcially want destress fun time aviation specificly feel seal clubbing happens atleast reveiw written common flying plane easy pulling manuevers hard todays pilots time pilot know complete practice ran lot pilots days recorded playing fighters attack planes fine vs noobies like having stealing baby game rewards players tankers pilots way seal clubbing letting use xp gained tank plane currently reseaching tanks research tanks planes planes respectivly personally nt think stop playing game reveiw like playing game looking getting game know tanks planes games teir ahead ment good flying c br rating slightly want facing biplanes br rating flat flimy struts know lot grinding plane tank want play like mentioned earlier nt buy tank progessing line getting better verient plane think game improve instead sprinkling planes tanks adding new teir xp wo nt long time maybe increase variety planes add tanks historicly italian line thing think nice group people starting nation starter tanks planes learning enviornment nt know community toxic maybe punish freindly fire nt suggest person thing game mechanic thing want war thunder try highly recomend trying warry

The false advertising rubbed me in all the wrong ways however; this game is not free to play (unless you like a hiking simulator dressed up as a hunting simulator). To actually hunt in this game you have to spend real money on licenses, guns, etc. I'm hoping in the future that this game will actually allow you to hunt a bit more without spending money (or just costing money right off the bat).

394,13438,13442,Creativerse,"Honestly it's overall a good game, here are pro's and con's from my perspective.First, the bad stuff.Con:1. I dont like that f2p'ers are a captive audience for advertising Pro on the loading screens. I feel pro would sell better if they advertised it less, but then they do need to keep the lights on, I get it. 2. Here's the bull in the china shop. Lag. This game is not well optimized and can bring a modern gaming wonder to its knees. Pets and lighting, two important things, cause a lot of lag. There could be many optimizations made.3. Glitches. There are many position-based glitches that are very annoying, closing a door on yourself can send you to the top of the skybox, guaranteed death if you have no pro, and hitting blocks just right can also send you up, in addition to placing blocks over your feet. Keepas are very annoying for their high-jump abilities thanks to this. All of these are annoying. Also many games have developed a loading glitch where the world stops rendering in front of the player, and if they arent careful, they fall allllllllll the way down and THEN the game loads but now they are in the corruption layer with no escape. Also, as Murphy's Law dictates, right in front of a Thing.4. Money. Hey, I get it, you need money, but some of the micro transactions are a bit much. I think especially on smaller packs of items or outfits or recipes and such, the block/item count needs to be raised for it to be balanced. (edit: it has been raised, so thanks, but I'm leaving this in because it wasn't raised by a ton)5. Lighting. Okay guys, heres the issue. Lights in this game are way underpowered, and the textures for them dont fit a lot of buildings, or if they do, they are super bulky. I would like to see more lamp and lantern textures.6. Automation. Okay, so ths is coming after having played the game for over a thousand hours, and besides lag, I would have to say, my biggest desire for this game is automation. As of writing this, you can't automate processing or forging. Early game, this poses no problem, but late game, when (like me) you have 300 some odd processors to handle the massive capacities your builds need, it can get pretty tedious to put everything in a processor. It would be nice to like have a processor you could wire to a chest and preset to chop slabs, slopes, or rods. Same with furnaces. I can take care of capacity, just please please please please please dont make me have to go through EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of them to process a bunch of stuff. It would be so nice to be able to (late-game, again) pop a bunch of items into a chest and come back later, open the output chest, and have it all done neatly. I would freaking love you guys.Yeah I'll shut up now...Okay now for the fun stuff.Pro:1. Yeah the ads are annoying, but I do have to say, pro is worth the 20 bucks, so good job on that. 2. The one glitch I love: the terrible aero system. You guys have a grotequely innaccurate aerodynamic system for the glider, and it's amazing. It allows skilled flyers to gain altitude over time without using boost. Its pretty great, I'd honestly be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if it got removed. It adds a TON of usefulness to the glider. Honestly, I'm rather surprised most people dont know how to utilize this.3. The tech. This game has more comprehensive in-depth logic gates and stuff than most minecraft style games, and once you get the hang of it its great. The arc signs are tons of fun. Just add more to it and please folks, for the love of God, please stop changing the arc sign sprites.4. Textures. This game is quite pretty, and besides the above issues, the prettiness is great. They're also fairly clever in marketing certain textures without it being forced. You can buy them, but you are totally fine without them.5. Rotation. I played some minecraft, and in just a few hours, I instantly missed my precious rotation from this game. Sure, its a bit wonky, but it's miles better than trying to stand in all the most awkward places possible just to make a build look how you want it to.6. Farming. Lots of people complain how there is no creative mode, but honestly, this game is far more generous in farming resources than Minecraft, the game everyone compares it to. It takes less farming to build more resources, so I like the fact that after you're done with the early game, it kinda settles down to a pleasant middle ground between survival and creative. I can get how it's not for some people, but for me, it's nice. Farming feels fairly rewarding, without feeling hollow like creative can, so when you have a hugely massive creation, you can feel proud that you farmed all those resources.7. Stack Size. Right alongside farming resources, the new and improved stack size of 999 is soooooo much nicer than 64.Not only can you make tons of stuff, you can now hoard it too! I should know, I hoard everything (even Pebble's Pebbles. I mean seriously, who uses them? But I hoard em anyway. Why not? I got the space!) so go nuts.Overall, this game basically covers what I originally wanted from minecraft, the ability to build huge stunning creations people appreciate.

410,9512,9516,Realm of the Mad God,"Realm of the Mad God is a medieval-themed rogue-like with 2D pixel graphics. There is no story or campaign, only some background lore. The object in the game is to wreck havoc and kill creatures on a  huge  island (the realm). These creatures are Oryx's (the Mad God) minions. Killing them will earn exp and drop some occasional loot. Killing tougher monsters (gods) will♥♥♥♥♥♥Oryx off (hence the name:  Mad  god). When angry, Oryx will teleport the players on the island to his castle, where they will attempt to kill Oryx. When succeeded, players will teleport to another realm, starting the chain again.The game is proper fun for the first couple of hours. After that the flaws will start to point out, including annoyingly repeatitive soundtrack. It is less than two minutes long 8-bit chant.-There are too few levels (only 20), and the highest level will be achieved in just a couple of hours, tops. Each level-up will give you higher stats, determined by your class. Even after reaching lvl 20, you can still get your stats higher by consuming stat potions. The stats will eventually max out, making the corresponding number turn gold/yellow.-The equippable items are quite interesting. There are four types of equippable items: weapon, class skill, armor and ring.   There are five tiers of class skills and rings, and 10+ tiers of armors and weapons.-There are several different classes with different skills and stats for different playstyles, which makes the game much   more interesting. At first most of the classes are locked, but they can be unlocked by playing and performing well with   the earlier classes.The game is completely free, which means a strong pay-to-win aspect. There is a tremendous spike in difficulty after reaching certain areas. After traveling deep enough to the center of the island (or teleporting to hard dungeons), the game becomes somewhat unplayable. The monsters' health and damage are high enough to end your journey in a blink.Do I recommend the game? It depends on the player's expectations.

411,7156,7160,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"While the prospect of getting more Elder Scrolls lore while waiting on the next mainline game to come out may seem attractive, Legends is not worth the hassle. It's a Hearthstone clone, more or less. Pleagued by the same RNG and money-grabbing issues thatp lague ALL CCGs. Every element of the game is rigged to extort money from you. If you want a remotely competitive deck, as with all CCGs, be prepared to blow $100 on card packs so you can RNG the cards you need or get the dust you need to craft them. The non-paid content will last you a few hours at most, and then the game will begin demanding money for a few more hours, which will be depleted after you chew through it because they only have a few content packs out now. All of which are hideously overpriced because the people who DO spend money on CCGs buy the packs 40 at a time. Because as psychological research has shown us, CCGs and other microtransaction schemes are tailored to prey on ""whales"". People with compulsive personality disorders or poor impulse control who cannot resist the urge to see what comes out of that next pack, or what card comes off the top of their deck next. They're biologically predisposed to take risks, minimize losses, overstate their gains, and keep pulling any lever or pushing any button that makes pleasant noises or flashes pretty lights at them. Game devs know this, so they make their games to milk these ""whales"" for their money. Legends is no different.Beyond the hideously exploitative pricing model, the game itself is the usual RNG garbage that all CCGs are. You can be mopping the floor with someone and be up 20hp one turn, then the next they luck into a card combo that wins them the game. Likewise, you can be struggling all game against someone and then RNG hands you the perfect cards to turn the game around while stiffing your opponent. There's very little personal skill or tactical thinking involved. The personal skill element boils down to making a balanced deck and making wise trades in the games.That's maybe 30% of what determines who wins and who loses. Another 10% is probably the rock-paper-scissors game design philosophy that plays out like: Decks that spawn lots of small enemies lose to decks that spawn big enemies lose to decks with a lot removal/lethality lose to decks with lots of small enemies. The other 60% is all luck. Plain, boring, dumb luck.I can't recommend this or any other CCG. Ever. If you love these games, seek help instead.

417,10660,10664,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewAfter almost 200 hours and achieving the rank of Master two season's in a row, I feel like I can write a proper review for Eternal. This game is great. It's almost disgustingly free to play. You'll be showered in packs and cards when you first begin, and getting a free card pack on your first ranked win a day has kept me returning time and time again. However, if you're looking for a cheap alternative to Hearthstone, you're probably looking for Shadowverse. Eternal isn't an easy game by any means. The power system is very similar to Magic The Gathering, which can be very off-putting for anyone who hasn't played it before. I believe drawing mana makes the game more complex and allows for a wider array of decks than could ever be achieved in a system that gives you one mana every turn. If the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bothers you, this just isn't going to be the game for you. If you've been looking for a complex CCG with all the deep mechanics of Magic the Gathering while also being very generous in how easy it is to collect, I cannot recommend Eternal enough.TL;DR: Not great if you're just tired of Hearthstone, but if you're willing to sit down and learn it's quirks, there is a truly complex and interesting card game that is very accomodating of small budget.",1, early access reviewafter hours achieving rank master season row feel like write proper review eternal game great disgustingly free play showered packs cards begin getting free card pack ranked win day kept returning time time looking cheap alternative hearthstone probably looking shadowverse eternal easy game means power system similar magic gathering putting played believe drawing mana makes game complex allows wider array decks achieved system gives mana turn occasional mana flood mana screw bothers going game looking complex ccg deep mechanics magic gathering generous easy collect recommend eternal great tired hearthstone willing sit learn quirks truly complex interesting card game accomodating small budget

The Mustang is also a good place to start.4- There are beautiful and realistic collection of modules that can be purchased.5- Manuals look cool on a desk when printed.7- Since you saved some money not paying for the game itself, and before you get sucked in and buy every single airplane available, invest in a quality joystick.*The Steam version of DCS rarely get modules and updates on time, expect to wait a lot of time for new airplanes.",1, dcs world simply best combat flight simulator free easy fly t combat airplane non combat non armed mustang fun settings allow stuff easier starting sure simulator try maybe fly cessna getting mustang good place beautiful realistic collection modules manuals look cool desk saved money paying game sucked buy single airplane available invest quality steam version dcs rarely modules updates time expect wait lot time new airplanes
423,8215,8219,Neverwinter,"Model (F2P): The biggest downside to the game is its Zen system which, I suppose is the only way for a free MMO to make money, as one would expect from a F2P model. Unlike in games like Path of Exile, the items purchased with Zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantages that free players would not have access to at a much earlier level. However, there is a way to convert in game currency (Astral Diamonds) into Zen at a conversion rate that changes depending on the market. Neverwinter sometimes pushes the player to use special currencies in order to open lockboxes containing level-appropriate equipment, but is otherwise not too intrusive. Unfortunately, the in-game currency of Zen-to-Dollar ratio uses an extremely expensive conversion when compared to other F2P games such as Rift. While most decent item sets cost somewhere between 1500-3000 zen, approximately 500 zen = $5, depending on how many Zen are purchased at once.Gameplay: Some of the most innovative and fun combat you'll find in the current MMO scene. The classes are very well fleshed-out, but definitely not balanced as of yet. Most classes require re-positioning, timing, and anticipation when reacting to enemies or even allies' actions. It's definitely not a click and spam blindly game. Unique mechanics are introduced depending on the class. A Guardian Fighter can hold up a shield to block attacks, while a Rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike. Every class feels truly unique and full of flavor. The combat system is mostly based on a D&D-type of ruleset with skilltrees in the form of feats and eventual specialization. While questing is very linear and everything else is pretty much what you would expect in a standard MMO, the profession system is more of a que-and-wait.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who's awaiting WildStar and its combat system and wants something similar to satisfy their hunger for ARPG-type combat. Additionally, creative minds can use this game to create scenario-type quests and dungeons through a feature I personally have not used much called the Foundry.Multiplayer: Standard faire for the current MMO market. PVP scenarios of varying types pitting 5v5, co-op challenges that can quickly be completed with friends or random players, and dungeons. Lots of variety for all types of players and a guild system. Most players use the in-game chat to find groups or members. No innovation, but definitely satisfying for those who don't like soloing.7.5/10",1, model biggest downside game zen system suppose way free mmo money expect model unlike games like path exile items purchased zen definitely game altering offer advantages free players access earlier level way convert game currency astral diamonds zen conversion rate changes depending market neverwinter pushes player use special currencies order open lockboxes containing level appropriate equipment intrusive unfortunately game currency zen dollar ratio uses extremely expensive conversion compared games rift decent item sets cost zen approximately zen depending zen purchased gameplay innovative fun combat find current mmo scene classes fleshed definitely balanced classes require positioning timing anticipation reacting enemies allies actions definitely click spam blindly game unique mechanics introduced depending class guardian fighter hold shield block attacks rogue quickly close distance teleporting strike class feels truly unique flavor combat system based type ruleset skilltrees form feats eventual specialization questing linear pretty expect standard mmo profession system que wait overall recommend game awaiting wildstar combat system wants similar satisfy hunger arpg type combat additionally creative minds use game create scenario type quests dungeons feature personally called foundry multiplayer standard faire current mmo market pvp scenarios varying types pitting co op challenges quickly completed friends random players dungeons lots variety types players guild system players use game chat find groups members innovation definitely satisfying like

Does all that hard work need a monthly renewal to be retained after you level up!?If it doesn't vanish, what happens on the flip side?Remember that one time you played that one randomed hero you don't ever usually play and leveled him to a really really low rank? The Meta will change, and maybe you'll pick that hero more and more in the future. But now, whenever you replay him, people will see that lowly rank forever after the subscription expires.

433,16802,16807,Cuisine Royale,"Early Access ReviewI've been playing CS for almost 20 years. It's my number one game. In those 20 years I always looked for other fun games to play in between CS games.I played HL: Deathmatch, Day of Defeat, All COD's until MW2, MOH, Unreal Tournemant, Quake, ... I enjoyed all of them! More recently I tried and played several other games looking for something new! Destiny 2... Hated it... Fortnite... Absolutely terrible!!! The latest COD WW2 enjoyed the single player but multiplayer wasn't my thing. I got all hyped for Battalion 1944 but until now it dissapointed me. I will give it another chance though as they are still working on the game.The one game I tried and kept playing was PUBG. Although the game was not optimized well had all of its flaws, it was fun to play for a few rounds. What I don't understand is that people can play it for hours on end... It gets so ♥♥♥♥ing boring! The recent update with the smaller map and more loot was a change I liked but overall for me the game is broken... I ♥♥♥♥ing HATE the game! It got great potential but the developers are just milking the cow now in my opinion. Hence I deleted the game and searched for something new.Enter Cuisine Royale! Free! Early access! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME! So early in development it looks better, feels better and is optimized better then PUBG.Spray patterns and hitboxes are already really good but can still be improved. I like the random spawn points. Loot is balanced pretty good. Sometimes you can be unlucky with loot but if you play it right you will always find something to get a kill and steal there loot. I personally like the funny gadgets and perks but even without them the game would be a lot of fun. It could be interesting in the future the have several game modes. One like it is now and one that is more realistic. A mode without the bunny slippers, actual backpacks instead of shopping bags, realistic armor and helmets, would probably attract a lot more players to the game.What should be improved at this time is to have the lobby actually in the game. Cause right now you need to enter a game to be able to change your settings. Key binds are also not working for me. I can't seem to change them. Also missing an option to bind every weapon on one key. Primary, Secondary. All I see is previous weapon which I don't like.In game the developers should just keep doing what there doing. I think there doing a great job!They keep bringing updates that fixes bugs and bring improvements to the game!As the game is free, there is no reason not to try it!Would I pay for this game?

Between people that disconnect early because your not playing to their standards, armchair generals shouting tactics with a broken caps lock, racists and mouthy trolls with broken caps lock and the people that surrender and quit the minute the game SEEMS to be going badly(HUGE PET PEEVE), are slowly killing this game.

These issues can be fixed with a simple option to censor certain players chat and to remove THE DAMN SURRENDER OPTION.

There's more play options available on this game than any MtG app I've found, so replayability/longevity isn't a going to be an issue.If you're in the same boat as me - you like playing MtG but don't have anyone to play with as often as you'd like - I highly recommend getting this game.

447,13340,13344,Creativerse,"In short: It's great. It's free. Bought content is really not necessary. Bought content isn't very expensive anyway. Very easy multiplayer. Lots of stuff to build with and also wiring systems (yes, also free). No mods so far, but enough content itself. Buy the stuff, support the devs.Long version:I gotta say I'm not a Minecraft enthusiast. I mean, it was first. And my son played it a lot. And I played it too, and it's awesome in its way and it's kind of the game I wanted when I was younger, but so is Creativerse. First things first, also because I noticed that it's the highlight of most negative reviews: Is this pay to win? No. If you buy the pro version you get some wings, a flashlight more customization options for your world and you can have multiple worlds. Among other things. BUT you won't receive any better weapons or superior blueprints or whatever... Pro gives you stuff, but nothing mandatory.Same goes for the other stuff you can buy. Yeah, if you want some fancy medieval things you gotta invest about 10€ to buy 1000 coins and the medieval castle bundle, BUT you can go with the vanilla craftable furniture and so on as well. There's enough to choose from. Want fancy stained glass blocks? That's some 3€ or so... Developers need money to develop, and this game gives you all of the content for free and makes you pay very fair prices for extras.Creativerse makes a pretty young impression and there are a few obvious glitches, but nothing serious. The game doesn't take you by the hand, but most things are pretty intuitive. And if they're not, you are being told how stuff works. Multiplayer works flawlessly so far, you can also teleport to specific player's teleportstones which makes it easier to join up. Apart from the usual building-with-blocks things there's also some tech stuff and a device which enables you to easily wire switches with doors and other things, also with logic gates inbetween. It's really just connecting dots and feels a bit like the same feature for the DOOM snapmap editor. The game looks and feels good so far and apart from crashing two times (without any progress lost by the way), it runs smoothly. I'm not sure about the biomes. There are lots of those, but I'd love to see more and bigger ones. But anyway, I liked those I saw, also the deep and pretty dangerous caves.Not sure if a minecraft fanboy/-girl would like Creativerse (or any other block based game that is not Minecraft), but I like it very much and even bought the pro version, though not only for the benefits, but also because l like to support the developers. I'd love to see this game ripe and grow adult.

462,9589,9593,Realm of the Mad God,"Changed my mind this game sucks, Thumbs Down now. You can still read the review if you want.Alright so It looks like that i'm the only one here now with an insane amount of hours that still actually thinks this is a good game, not entirely ruined by the company. This is a game where if you play a lot you're going to be good. If you play a lot you're going to get good gear. It's not as if the company Kabam being greedy is taking the core away from the game, just because Kabam is a greedy company it shouldnt take away from the fact that you can still enjoy the game without paying a lot of money.If you come into a F2P game and expect to not spend any money then you were mistaken to even set foot in it in the first place because you all know as well as I do what the F2P business model is.There are a lot of things that which you must buy to fully enjoy the game for what it is, but like I said that should be expected for most F2P games today. You may need vault chests, which is 500 Gold each which equals 5USD. You may need a character slot, which the first few are cheap but the rest cost about 1000 gold, which equals 10USD. But you do not need to buy all of these seperartely, they do frequently release GOOD packs that allow you to actually save on some money if you wait for one of them, for example the play more pack can have 1 character slot 1 vault and 2 backpacks, which is a 2000 gold value for only 1000 gold.So if you decide you want to play this game then give it a shot but do not expect to not pay anything if you plan on playing it a lot.Now I will say that even I am not the happiest with Kabam, they're very sloppy, greedy, and slow with content. But that does not make this a bad game. I repeat for the 50th time that does not make this a bad game. I just makes a game that is ran by a bad company. Everyone here downvoting this game because of the company is just wrong because you cant judge the game itself like that, you're taking away from other people who may geniuenly enjoy this game for what it is, because you gave it a bad review when it doesnt deserve it.

463,6959,6963,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"Absolutely love this game. It's easily my favorite DCCG. Coming from Hearthstone and want to know what sets it apart? This is based on probably a hundred or so hours playing the game using the Bethesda launcher. Here are the major differences from Hearthstone to get you started:1. Rewards, in general, are much more generous. This is partly because of point #3 with bigger deck sizes and can have 3 copies of many of the Legendaries. You get like 10-50 gold and a spare card (can even be Legendary or a pack!) every 3 wins instead of just 10 gold. WAY better. End of season rewards... I forget how HS works, but you get a ton of gold and soul gems and like 1-3 packs for end of season purely based on what rank you are. In addition, they release a new card every month, and you get 1-3 copies based on your rank as well! 1 copy at rank 9 or better, 2 copies at rank 5, 3 copies at rank 1. You can craft monthly cards anytime after that for ones you've missed, but you'll never find them in packs.2. Generally less RNG than HS. The randomness that is in the game (for the most part) has some interesting control, and not totally random. The really RNG cards typically aren't competitive, but still fun to throw 1 or 2 in your deck at times.3. Solo Arena. Basically like Versus Arena, but against enemy AI. You earn cards in a similar fashion, same type of 30-card draft, but against enemy AI with random lane and game start effects. Rewards are similar to HS as well. Guaranteed pack for playing, even if you lose all 3. Infinite time to play, THIS COUNTS FOR QUESTS. There is no timer for playing, so you can take forever or walk away to do something if you get pulled away. I think you can even log off and it will pick up right where you left off if you join back in. Same goes for Practice mode, which I'll go into later.4. Constructed decks have 50-70 cards, with 1 Unique copy of each Legendary allowed. If it's not Unique (the Golden circle at the top of some Legendary cards), you can still have 3 copies of a Legendary card, or any other card except ones marked Unique.5. Constructed ladder. You win, you gain a star. Lose, you lose a star. However, you can't go down in rank in a given month. You go down to a separate 2-star constellation (rank) called Serpent. Below rank 5, a Bonus Round will randomly be in a given match. In that match, the winner gains 2 stars. The loser still loses 1.6. Now for the big ones. Lanes. There are 2 of them. Yippee... you say sarcastically. But really it changes the play a LOT more than you'd think. I've heard it helps the defender. Left lane is normal. The right lane is, by default, the Shadow Lane. Every creature played here gains Cover for one turn. This can be played around and affected. Some cards can Move, or switch lanes, as part of their lane effects. Trust me when I say: 2 lanes are better than 1. I was made a believer.7. The other BIG one. Prophecies and Runes. Here's where things get really interesting. Each player has 5 runes to start the game, at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 health. When your health drops below 25 for any reason, no matter whose turn it is), you draw a card. If it has the Prophecy keyword, you get to play the card IMMEDIATELY (even during your opponent's turn), for no magicka cost, if you so choose. You can also choose to put the card in your hand. This rule goes for both players with all decks in every game type. This obviously has HUGE implications. Because there aren't many cards with Prophecy, breaking Runes in and of itself is an important decision every time. The only exception to this rule and all others is, if any player ever drops below 1 health for any reason on any turn, the game is over. Prophecies can be skipped in this way, if 6 damage is done in one attack, the last rune is ""skipped"". Knowing what class and colors you're playing against is key to playing around potential effects during your turn. Speaking of colors and classes...8. Card colors / classes / card synergy / creativity. There are 5 colors, Red (Strength), Green (Agility), Blue (Intelligence), Yellow (Willpower), Purple (Endurance), plus Neutral (gray). Each color has a general theme, but can play any archetype (won't be top tier, but a taste of it). This is for balance, variety, synergy, and creativity. For example, Purple cards generally are stickier with slightly higher stats. Many Green cards are reactive or mobile (can Move between lanes). The 10 classes are all combinations of 2 of the 5 colors, plus Neutral cards can be in any deck. The Summon ability will activate any time that card comes into play, even if another card summons it. This makes for MUCH more card synergy than Battlecry in HS, which only activated when the card was played from your hand.9. You can play Practice mode to get soul gems. 5 for a win against Easy, 10 against Normal, 15 against Expert. 300 gems per day cap. A Legendary every 4 days if you max it. Not bad with very fast aggro decks like mono red. You play against a random class with standard lane effects and starting conditions.10. Chaos Arena is very fun and helps shakes things up once a month for the weekend. Random lane conditions and special conditions even on top of that sometimes. It's the first ""new"" game mode they've introduced.11. A few new keywords. Haven't played HS in a while so some of these may be dupes. Breakthrough lets you overkill a creature into their face for damage. Pilfer activates any time the creature damages the enemy hero. Regenerate brings that creatures current health back to maximum at the beginning of your turn. Drain gives your hero back the same amount of health as the attack damage it deals.12. No Secrets (Prophecies fill that role), but Supports instead. These are either limited use or perpetual, until removed. There are a few cards that can remove Supports. They typically either buff all your creatures while in play, summon a creature per turn, or buff 1 of your creatures with limited uses.13. A few cards trigger if you have more health than your opponent. You may have noticed that 2 lanes and Runes / Prophecy tend to favor the defender, but clearly this favors the aggressor to maintain balance. These mighty few let aggro decks maintain momentum through all those extra (and potentially free) cards.14. Heroes can never attack. Can't equip your hero with items. No hero powers.

If you play for the fun of the game only it is great, the moment you start to want to progress be prepared to pay, cause after you hit a certain tier the maintenance cost of keeping your planes flying outweighs the rewards you get from playing.

This is that game. Fallout 4 is out? This is free, and I need to scratch my itch. Smite is a very well balanced 3rd person take on a MOBA that can attract anyone from a hardcore LoL player to a gamer whose never stepped foot in the genre (aka myself). Besides the current hours I have, another 500 can be added from Xbox playtime. The game is very easy to get into as a casual, but also very fun for people who love to customize builds and find what numbers need to be allocated where to be the most effective (power, attack speed, protections, etc.).Smite is constantly updated, with small patches every few weeks. Also, a new god is added every month or two, allowing the player to always have someone new to try. When you first start out, you are given a few free gods (some are top tier, think of stock guns in TF2) and a few gods are free every week for you to test drive. I would highly recommend the God Pack for anyone who thinks they will sink a decent amount of time into the game. It makes you much more flexible as a player, gives variety to the game, and lets you try what seems to be an endless amount of playstyles that you may have not be able to experience prior. Gems, Smite's premium currency, is given in small doeses every week from logging in, can be bought, and is often given for free from weekend events. Also, skins/voice packs are often on sale. Devs are in constant contact on r/Smite and Twitter, making it extremely easy to contact them for any concerns, and easy for them to see community ideas. They are also some pretty fun guys that are always fun to see on stream or during events.The game's free, give it a try and see how you like it.

475,2803,2806,War Thunder,"Throughout the course of this game, my opinion has largely changed. I used to recall on the game as a pioneer of the aircraft simulator franchise as it embarked into the realms of World War II and its epic course, now I can only review this game as a mediocre displacement from that former realization of it being a ""wonder"". To begin, the company, Gaijin Entertainment, is ridiculous at best. I used to be a strong advocate of another title of the company - Star Conflict - until they nearly dedicated all resources to War Thunder alone. The company is infamous for dropping titles and other assets in pursuit of other monetary ventures. I still rather miss playing Star Conflict as it felt like a new take on space combat (Mind you, this was before Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and several other acclaimed space simulators to be). Though my regards on Star Conflict do not reflect War Thunder, it reflects my opinion of the company that seems like it desires to be the next EA of Russia. Oh that reminds me, in its conveying of the depressing updates of Star Conflict, and other titles, they apparently have no English representive (Or that person needs to be fired) as it seems like the company uses Google Translate to loosely translate press releases to the customer. Personally, I like to hold onto Star Conflict and War Thunder simply so that I can read statements with grammatical errors so blatantly obivious, it is a pain to the eye while a laughter to the brain. To the matters of War Thunder, I used to play this game on a daily basis - to this day I maintain 175.5 hours - I would most likely have 1,000+ if I did not stop playing this game however. With the release of patch 1.37, to ""decrease"" waiting times for flight battles, Gaijin decided to remove several tiers and merge them into a few. Now, what does that mean? It means instead of matching against a player with a similar aircraft tier, it means going against individuals that can either be incredibly above you in level or incredibly low. To me, this seems like an attack against those who are just picking up War Thunder. How is it that a company can maintain a player basis when it invites new ones into battles that are significantly outmatched? I suppose the developers are able to achieve this, but I suppose the fame will outrun its course.As a reflection though of the current update, Ground Combat, I was elated beyond scale. I stayed up overnight to download the update and to finally get into my tank to discover how fun it was. While the ground forces update is exceptional, it is amazingly generic. I would dare to say it seems like Gaijin dissected World of Tanks to mirror the tanks and battles to the very   controls and combat. Personally, I almost laugh simply because I have wondered if Gaijin Entertainment and WarGaming (Developers of World of Tanks, Wartanks, and Warships) are brothers - family in ownership.Though my opinion and reflection of War Thunder is based primarily upon patch 1.37 and the company's background, I cannot sadly recommend this game. I still take fun in participating in air battles and tank battles on the occasion. Knowing the company's background, I cannot but wonder when they devise a new title that maintains such high success if not higher than War Thunder, when they will suddenly drop frequent updates to pursue the next monetary venture. If you're interested, look up Star Conflict on Steam and review updates and other news for the game. Everytime that I do that now, I simply get depressed. I wonder if people even know that this company has maintained other somewhat successful titles before this one, considering it seems like Gaijin throws old titles and other former successes off a cliff into a void of neglect. In my opinion, if a company releases a title, that company must maintain fixes for bugs and glitches while releasing new content to increase the player basis - in a professional manner. Considering Gaijin most likely uses Google Translate rather than an English interpreter, translations of the updates and other press notices are astounding. My yet born nephew would probably understand and convey English better than Gaijin. NOTE: This review reflects mainly upon the ethics of the company. If you are looking for a game to play occasionally that reflects your desires to defeat the Axis or Allied Powers of World War II in a simulated fashion, I would recommend this game. Though, I would stay WarGaming's titles would be a better choice. As a very frequent gamer, please take into account the ethics of  Gaijin - the next EA of Russia.

484,15115,15120,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewYou can see that i spent one hour in the game, but i only gave this game the final shot before writing this review and unfortunately for this game, it took this long to get into single battle.I started to play it in late 2014 using robocraft launcher and managed to reach t7 in 3-4 days or so. Queue times were short and battles were fun, though the more i progressed the more cheaters i saw. It was the main problem those days. Developers tried to make authoritative server to solve the issue, but failed at that (because of obvious reason) and chosen EasyAntiCheat. Since it is client thing, it did not filter all the cheaters, and caused issues for many fair players because of how it is designed. After a while they decided to push another update, where they removed repair cost completely. Many players liked it, but mostly those who couldn't build a proper robot and those who often leave the battle in the middle of the game.In another huge update they changed the default game mode, that was a mistake once again, because new game mode was bugged and each round took a lot of time, making the players both play with half a team (because of explained above reason) and wait much longer between rounds.Of course there were some good updates and things too, like megabots and medics, but they cant overweight the bad ones.I stopped to play this game because it is very choppy. Seriously, i posted bug reports related to this several times almost a 8-9 months ago and it is still not fixed.

Pretty expansive variety of races and classes, with few restrictions if any (evil races can play as good classes by betraying and vice versa).I would still recommend buying a subscription if you want to play endgame content (removes most limitations), and unfortunately there are a couple extra features that need to be bought outside of that, but if you buy the sub, you can collect the credits to get those free of charge anyhow. Not sure how playing free through the whole game would be, but I'm sure it's both viable and still fun.The lore in this game is incredible if you're into deep storylines. I wouldn't say the questing feels as epic as it did in the original Everquest, but some of the story arcs can make you feel like your character is the hero he or she is espoused to be. Plus, the game still receives consistent updates and I've even seen guide-run events (by volunteers or employees in game) more recently.Playerbase can be a bit slim, but when a new server launches, usually there's a ton of people who come out.If you're into MMO's, don't mind a bit of grind and graphics that aren't cutting edge, I'd recommend trying this game!",1, older game sure charm holds special place heart having played young definitely grind want run content wanted right action fairly certain speed quickly pretty expansive variety races classes restrictions evil races play good classes betraying vice recommend buying subscription want play endgame content removes limitations unfortunately couple extra features need bought outside buy sub collect credits free charge sure playing free game sure viable fun lore game incredible deep storylines questing feels epic original everquest story arcs feel like character hero espoused plus game receives consistent updates seen guide run events volunteers employees game recently playerbase bit slim new server launches usually ton people come mmo mind bit grind graphics cutting edge recommend trying game

489,13748,13752,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewThis game is not another Minecraft clone, this game has gone where Minecraft should have gone.Graphically the world is beautiful with a good variety of biomes. Character customisation is limited, but you do at least look like a human and not a collection of blocks. And the same can be said for the creatures, all utterly charming, even when they're beating the hell out of you. Watching a pigsie strut its stuff, or a pebble scatter around on the beach never gets commonplace.The harvesting mechanic is streamlined - no need to carry lots of different tools for different jobs.Crafting is well thought out, intuitive and without the need to memorise recipes.Mining is actually fun. Exploring caverns and coming across ores is heaven for a pack rat like me.Building is very well catered for - without the need to mod up to get those slopes or barred windows. The variety in materials is excellent, and being able to rotate blocks to show different surfaces was a terrific idea!Farming is fun - watching the Chizzard straining to lay an egg when you harvest her is amusing. And it offers a useful alternative to killing creatures for drops.The UI is smooth and easy to use.Travel is, again, well thought out. Find a great area you want to return to? No problem, plonk down a teleporter.Combat and the map are pants - but who cares - there's so much to do, even now whilst it is still in Early Access. And there is no controller support yet, which to this armchair player is top of my wish list.The Devs interact with and listen to the community meaning many changes are player driven. Tweaks and updates are regular - it really feels like people are working on and developing the game.Single player or hook up with up to 19 friends.This is a very polished game especially considering it is Early Access.And best of all - you can try it for free! There are limitations, like you can only have one world, but you have access to practically the entire game content right from the get go.

493,11355,11359,Black Squad,"Early Access ReviewDISCLAIMER: As the game is in early access and seems to be a game made to last for a long time, points made in this review are subject to change in the future.First view:It's relatively well balanced between ARs and snipers (haven't seen any shotguns used yet) as well as pistols, everything feels great, it's easy to run as it doesn't require any high-end equipment (I get 180 frames on my GTX 1060 laptop), doesn't have ping issues (unless you're far from every server possible), has quite a lot of people playing even early in the morning, doesn't seem to have any big hacker problem (unlike CS:GO and post-year COD games) and gives the same feeling of joy I had playing Combat Arms for the first time in 2008.The game gives you plenty of in-game currency to buy at least one weapon of choice right off the bat and doesn't seem to have any weapon that would cost hundreds of hours to acquire. It also doesn't have anything P2W related, as the only microtransactions available are for skins (at least as far as I can see).Conclusion:If you want a F2P FPS, this is the one. As a fan of FPS games, I am very satisfied with the current game, especially considering it's made by a relatively new studio as their first game ever (they started the company in late 2011, so 6 and a half years ago). I cannot wait to see what they add in the future, and I will gladly keep an eye out for any new releases they might have for us in the future.",1, early access reviewdisclaimer game early access game long time points review subject change future view relatively balanced ars snipers seen shotguns pistols feels great easy run require high end equipment frames gtx laptop ping issues far server possible lot people playing early morning big hacker problem unlike cs post year cod games gives feeling joy playing combat arms time game gives plenty game currency buy weapon choice right bat weapon cost hundreds hours acquire related microtransactions available skins far want fps fan fps games satisfied current game especially considering relatively new studio game started company late half years ago wait add future gladly eye new releases future

517,931,934,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewWhile matchmaking is still being worked on, I can honestly say that the connection quality has shown some improvements, and I'm hopeful for the future. While it lacks the intense customization of games like DotA and LoL, it's current game format heavily resembles the balancing act that is involved with those games. Controlling stations gains you resources which level your team up, the more stations you control on the map, the faster you level, which in turn strengthens your teams ships. However, killing isn't the goal in this game, rather the capture of enemy forward bases to open the way for your team to capture their home base. Capturing stations will net you more resources, but also will signal to the enemy which sectors you're advancing on and where they should divert more ships to counter. There's a small series of tutorial missions that will enable you to get a sense of the basic mechanics of the game and how to move about, but it's up to you to get an idea of the tactics and strategy. There's currently three factions of ships, each with their own unique classes and abilities, so there's plenty of variety in the different ship classes, and there is also the chance to further tweak your ships through the uses of different crews and weapons. The game is slated to become Free-to-Play when it exits Early Access (may even be free now, not 100% sure) but, assuming there aren't any significant tweaks to the EXP and Credit rewards, the spectre of 'grind' doesn't seem to loom heavily as I've managed, as a rookie, to get around 1k of experience each game, making new ships availible every dozen games or so depending on my performance. Money will help unlock things faster, but the only things money can exclusively buy amount mostly to new skins for ships. It also helps that it scratches that capital ship itch. You know the one, the desire to maneuver a massive ship to bring an earth-shattering arsenal to bear on the enemy...",1, early access reviewwhile matchmaking worked honestly connection quality shown improvements hopeful future lacks intense customization games like dota lol current game format heavily resembles balancing act involved games controlling stations gains resources level team stations control map faster level turn strengthens teams ships killing goal game capture enemy forward bases open way team capture home base capturing stations net resources signal enemy sectors advancing divert ships counter small series tutorial missions enable sense basic mechanics game idea tactics strategy currently factions ships unique classes abilities plenty variety different ship classes chance tweak ships uses different crews weapons game slated free play exits early access free sure assuming significant tweaks exp credit rewards spectre grind loom heavily managed rookie experience game making new ships availible dozen games depending performance money help unlock things faster things money exclusively buy new skins ships helps scratches capital ship itch know desire maneuver massive ship bring earth shattering arsenal bear enemy

It's rather overwhelming, and quite time consuming)- Interface needs improvement(As for now, you have to browse huge lists just to find that one thing you want to make.

It's playable, it's enjoyable, and it has great potential. There has been a lot of thought put into the game, and I appreciate it. The game isn't there yet, hence the EA status.

But with the constant frameskips and jittering on a high end computer with the lowest graphics settings I doubt it will get better any time soon.I can not recommend this game for anyone.The game needs the following:* unique selling point (Combat System differences would be nice) * All features enabled or not have them visable.* Low settings should run at least 30fps for a majority of users.* Game should either be free with expensive non-essential skins or cost money and have cheap addons.* Filtering needs a toggle, be gutted, and rebuilt from a better dictionary of what to filter.Game is not worth monetary amount right now.I'll revisit the game in 6 months to see if it has changed for the better.",0, early access reviewi understand launch issues servers mmos problem planned combat unoriginal feel said different locked classes concern assassin mystic warlock locked able mechanics classes feel different debugging enabled understand fps drops constant frameskips jittering high end computer lowest graphics settings doubt better time soon recommend game game needs following unique selling point combat system differences nice features enabled visable low settings run majority users game free expensive non essential skins cost money cheap addons filtering needs toggle gutted rebuilt better dictionary filter game worth monetary right revisit game months changed better

532,11215,11219,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI had to change my review from negative to positive. The computer does cheat, but only after you go on a hot streak and win quite a few free packs. Then the A.I. just does what it wants and you will lose. But, I'm ok with that. As long as it doesn't ALWAYS cheat, I'm fine with the house needing to come out ahead sometimes, even if it's unfair.This game is a hell of a lot of fun, for both singleplayer and multi. If even a little bit of you loves TCG's, look no further, this has it all. And for the record, I did support this game by purchasing all the campaigns and 2 full boxes of cards. It's a great free game, but it absolutely is worthy of supporting it to keep it going.This was my original post. I have changed how I feel and updated above.Game was fun until they recently ""upgraded"" the A.I. to cheat like crazy during any singleplayer modes. The developers must have got tired of people doing well in Forge and Gauntlet, so now I regularly lose way before completeing either due to ridiculous ""draws"" by the computer.Scrounging for 2500 gold only to lose 2x on the first match of Forge has happened way too much since they changed things.Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.",1, early access reviewi change review negative positive computer cheat hot streak win free packs wants lose ok long cheat fine house needing come ahead unfair game hell lot fun singleplayer multi little bit loves tcg look record support game purchasing campaigns boxes cards great free game absolutely worthy supporting going original post changed feel updated game fun recently upgraded cheat like crazy singleplayer modes developers got tired people forge gauntlet regularly lose way completeing ridiculous draws computer scrounging gold lose match forge happened way changed things oh fun lasted

534,15843,15848,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewAdventure Quest 3D is the third Adventure Quest game so far. From what started as a simple but fleshed out in-browser web game has gone to a side-scrolling MMO and now a fully 3D RPGMMO. Honestly one the most underrated game series of all time Adventure Quest 3D only builds upon the already in depth lore. Not only did they recreate the original town of Battleon in 3D but they also expanded upon the simplistic combat style of the original game but added a more engaging feel to fighting overall. However I am a bit disappointed that they didn't include the Healer class from AQW. And the game has a wonderful sense of humor, rather than do the run-of-the-mill tutorial it thrusts you right in on the action while also adding in a sarcastic comment about it. AQ3D is simply not afraid to go against what has already been established in common RPGMMO games and going for a Morrowind type of questing, giving you a quest and a location and then having you go out and find the quest location. And you simply cannot ignore the fact of the seamless intergration of cross-platform play between PC, Apple and Android products. I would have to give this game an 8/10 and I can only imagine it will get better as time goes as Artix Entertainment updates their games frequently.",1, early access reviewadventure quest adventure quest game far started simple fleshed browser web game gone scrolling mmo fully rpgmmo honestly underrated game series time adventure quest builds depth lore recreate original town battleon expanded simplistic combat style original game added engaging feel fighting overall bit disappointed include healer class aqw game wonderful sense humor run mill tutorial thrusts right action adding sarcastic comment simply afraid established common rpgmmo games going morrowind type questing giving quest location having find quest location simply ignore fact seamless intergration cross platform play pc apple android products game imagine better time goes artix entertainment updates games frequently

536,10021,10025,Elsword,"This is a very combo focused game. There is a limit to how many hits you can land consecutively, so you'll have to figure out what sequence of attacks work well for you to deal as much damage during your combo. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the game (and maybe the only reason I play it) is the PvP arena. It's fun to play against others and you may meet some new friends or build up hate towards each other during PvP. You can play in 1v1's, 2v2's, or 3v3's. Just 2v2 matches get hectic, so you can only imagine how insane 3v3's can get. There are also fields for you to level up in and dungeons to do with auto selected parties or with your own party of people. The story quests are keen on making you repeat the same dungeons. However, it gets a little less repetitive later on. Though, that might just be me getting used to doing the same one dungeon over and over.

With numerous characters that fans of the series can relate to, all those familiar enemies and regular events that could see this competing with the already established games on the market.Some new players may find early game a little more difficult since the introduction of the Legends of Skyrim add-on as some of the cards require some balancing, however after you've collected a few of these cards you will notice the difference in the power of your deck.Obviously being a F2P you WILL encounter those pay to win players but that's just the way of the F2P business model!

Or if they decide to remove the combo system entirely, as they seem to have no idea of how to make it work.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6/5/2018 Edit: Translations are still improving, and devs are ""trying"" to balance classes for both PvP and PvE.

Occasional server lag, disconnects, and difficulty getting into the game, but the devs have been very responsive and are actively working with the community.There are some issues that are a direct result of Unreal Engine 3, such as objects loading slowly, and there are some questionable translations, especially in the tutorial but most of these will be fixed as time goes on.Despite all this, I'm enjoying the game. There are tons of creatures to tame and the combat is interesting, and will improve as the devs have announced action combat will be returning for all classes after some more tweaking.I really like that the servers balance the population between the factions, similar to Final Fantasy 14.

For those complaining about the online being hard it's because people playing this game on the PC are not used to brawlers or the strategy involved in them.(Not many brawler type games for the PC, even fewer have online gameplay.)      One good tip is when one guy has 9 points and the rest of the team is averaging around 2 then they need to work together to get the points balanced again.      Otherwise the guy with 9 point just has to get hit once by the lowest scorer and ""accidentally"" fall off the map whenever his damage is high to keep anyone else from getting anywhere near him score wise. (Easy win for anyone who actually read this.) There are many other tips and tricks assosiated with games exactly like this. But I'm too lazy to list em all.       Just use your heads people. (Something that pc gamers have been doing allot less of since game capable computers have become easily affordable for the generall public. Lets not end up like console online gaming.)     I wrote this review in hopes that I can inspire better tactics in the player base.... it's way to easy to win at the moment and it makes the game dull.

548,12506,12510,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"I didn't like R3E for a while and avoided purchasing any of the content but this game has come a long ways and Sector3 Studios has really changed the game around.First off the free to play portion of the game is more like a demo/base portion of the game. There are around 5 free cars and 2 tracks. This lets you try the game out and see if you like it. You purchase content (cars, tracks, packs, and experiences) based on what you want. You don't have to buy everything and most people don't.The packs are always discounted and go on sale frequently. Any content you have also gets discounted from packs and experiences.Experiences are basically full games that run through the base game of Raceroom. (So the DTM and ADAC GT experiences.)All the content I own I got on sale and I got DTM 2014 and WTC 2013 for free! I won these through the free competitions that are held in Raceroom. They cycle through these competitions around each month. Some are just for bragging rights and some have rewards such as the in game currency (VRP), game content, or even real race tickets.I have all the other big sims and I like raceroom for providing content that the other don't and also providing real race series with the tracks they race on. You can compete on the leaderboards with real race drivers in the DTM and ADAC GT series and they even host races with them from time to time.I definitely recommend trying it out and seeing if you like it. If you do, I suggest waiting for one of the sales either through raceroom or on steam, like the summer sale :).",1, like avoided purchasing content game come long ways studios changed game free play portion game like demo base portion game free cars tracks lets try game like purchase content cars tracks packs experiences based want buy people packs discounted sale frequently content gets discounted packs experiences experiences basically games run base game raceroom dtm adac gt content got sale got dtm wtc free won free competitions held raceroom cycle competitions month bragging rights rewards game currency vrp game content real race tickets big sims like raceroom providing content providing real race series tracks race compete leaderboards real race drivers dtm adac gt series host races time time definitely recommend trying seeing like suggest waiting sales raceroom steam like summer sale
549,4397,4401,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"First of all, the game is great however, it has issues in the game that I think Konami can fix but doesn't even bother trying to. I'll list down the pros and cons of this game.Pros:1. Good Visuals - Better than the later Yugioh games in the console2. Cross-platform - You can play this game in majority of the devices available. (PC, Mobile, Tablet)3. Simple Gameplay - If you play the regular game and find that its too convuluted ( you hate synchro/xyz/pendulums), but you love the old type of Yu-Gi-Oh, then this one is for you4. Abilities - Each character has an ability that makes you play the game in a unique way. Do you like to get the chance to pick the card you will draw in a pinch situation? What about you not getting any battle damage on your turn? How about you start off with always a specific card on the field? Then yeah, this game offers these abilities to give you unique game experience each timeCons:1. Bad shuffling algorithm - Sometimes, you feel like the game is rigged? Oh what about when you have like 16 monsters and 4 spell cards but you ended up drawing the 4 spell cards? Unlucky? - Unfortunately, the game's card shuffling algorithm is one of the worst ones you can find in a computer card game. It shuffles it out based on the arrangement of your deck in same sorting order that you use the deck builder. Basically if you have Ultra Rare and Rare cards, it will usually be the more common draws since its these cards that are in the top of the deck builder.2. Pay 2 Win - The game has a card shop where you can buy card packs for a cost of gems. These gems can be obtain through real cash or playing the game. The cards are locked in a chance, where the more packs you buy, the higher chances you get the right cards except you can just buy the promos where for 1$ you can open 3 packs + a guaranteed ultra rare.  It's a once a day promo but can you imagine that for a month you get to spent like 30 bucks. Well that's straight up being greedy.3. PVP Centric - Ok so you can play the game solo, with an AI then you can enjoy that right? Well the game has a stamina system where you can only play with the AI for a couple of plays by then if you want to continue, you either wait for the stamina to get refilled (or duelist fully spawned) or purchase an auto refill or play PVP unlimited where you face off people  who already boughts packs of cards in order to shove it to your face that you must pay to win against them. PERFECTHonestly, the game is enjoyable that's something we can agree on, but the fact that the game was design to become a quick cash grab is kinda sad and ruins the health of the game in long term.",0, game great issues game think konami fix bother trying list pros cons game good visuals better later yugioh games cross platform play game majority devices available pc mobile simple gameplay play regular game find convuluted hate synchro xyz pendulums love old type yu gi oh abilities character ability makes play game unique way like chance pick card draw pinch situation getting battle damage turn start specific card field yeah game offers abilities unique game experience bad shuffling algorithm feel like game rigged oh like monsters spell cards ended drawing spell cards unlucky unfortunately game card shuffling algorithm worst ones find computer card game shuffles based arrangement deck sorting order use deck builder basically ultra rare rare cards usually common draws cards deck pay win game card shop buy card packs cost gems gems obtain real cash playing game cards locked chance packs buy higher chances right cards buy promos open packs guaranteed ultra rare day promo imagine month spent like bucks straight pvp centric ok play game solo ai enjoy right game stamina system play ai couple plays want continue wait stamina refilled duelist fully spawned purchase auto refill play pvp unlimited face people boughts packs cards order shove face pay win perfecthonestly game enjoyable agree fact game design quick cash grab kinda sad ruins health game long term

554,14526,14531,Robocraft,"really want Free Jam to read this and new players to understand that I am speaking from a veteran's POV. This isn't meant to be a harsh. I want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the 3rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. I can't ""recommend"" this game YET but I do encourage people to try it. Robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before I can safely recommend it (I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT... I also want to emphasize that with each update, I have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). I want to give an overview of how I feel about robocraft and I will try to give an effective outline of what I want to say. This isn't me defending or bashing the game. This review is meant to be fair.I want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how I feel about it. I want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. I want to briefly mention the Factory. I want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). I want to talk about some issues I have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical ""It Sucks or ""I love crushing noobs"" or ""I get crushed by every meta/ pro user"") and offer a solution. I want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. I want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. I want to talk about Robocraft's community (There is might be some SALT in here. Be Warned). Finally, I will finalize with the largest problem I see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (If this is resolved, then I think it will help the game as a whole).The Current Movement system is VERY player friendly. You can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. Anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. I am not even joking. I made a Ugandan Knuckles Fly.  You can make tanks as well via tank treads. Mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ 3rd person point of view games. Camera controls are set as default to help people out. Keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. Wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). I don't advise them in tier 5. Heli-Copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. Hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very Overpowered. Currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. My solution is that Hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. Also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. Insect legs are very bad. They don't do as their were originally intended to do. When I use them, even when I don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. They don't cling to ceilings. As a solution, I made 2 insect bots that do these things but I had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (If interested, look up ""Block Widdow"" or ""The Hanger"" in the factory, use keyboard controls). The hanger demonstrates perfectly what I want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. The Block Widdow demonstrates what I want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like The Hanger is able to do. If insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. The current weapon balance in tier 5 is... Terrifying. The Mega Plasma (with the help of the trusty Power Module) CAN completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. The Rail Impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a ""rapid"" fire precision based weapon. The Mega SMG gun, well, its fine. The Flak Cannon is seriously weak. The LOML deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. The Mortar got nerfed hard, which I don't know how I feel about that since I started maining it until it got nerfed. The Shotgun (Ion Distorter) feels useless. Until weapons are balanced in way that is SATISFYING to FREE JAM (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. I feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. I am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (I consider block spam as the control group in this position). P. S. T0 smgs need an increased fire rate.The factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. The factory made a war between fighters and builders. The Fighters obviously win. I see far less builders than I do fighters in tier 5. The same goes to T1. I don't think there should be T1/T2 bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. I have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.In regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, I feel like they are too small. The old maps from the beginning, were really cool but I think Free Jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. I think there needs ro be more maps. More Maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. Or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. Or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.In Regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but I think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. When this game gets its player base up again, Have a League mode where all teirs are meshed together. Keep the current tier system the same. In regards to custom games, I think there should be a public/ private settings on it. I mean like allow people to random join. People will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. The Matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. For when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.The Community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. This will turn off new players to this game. I don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. When Free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) Robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. Free Jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of ""The game is dead"". Other than that, the community is cool. Lots of people are willing to help out. Also, New players shouldn't be able to get access to T5 parts so easily.Now to get to the root problem that plagues Free Jam. The main center of conflict that Free Jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. Solutions? Well I think if Free Jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. For content ideas, I would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. I would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. Thank you for your time. I encourage Free Jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. Again I can't recommend this game yet but I encourage people to try this game and share their views on it AND to share ideas.",1, want free jam read new players understand speaking veteran pov meant harsh want review detailed possible paragraph people read free jam recommend game encourage people try robocraft overcome hurdles safely recommend enjoy game want emphasize want emphasize update adapted changes ended enjoying later want overview feel robocraft try effective outline want defending bashing game review meant fair want talk current movement system robocraft feel want talk current weapons game current balancing want briefly mention factory want briefly mention feelings current maps general specifically want talk issues current matchmaking wo typical sucks love crushing noobs crushed pro user offer solution want talk use bots matchmaking want talk problems current custom game options offer solutions want talk robocraft community salt warned finally finalize largest problem hard deal propose solutions resolved think help game current movement system player friendly type movement bot plane wings propellers joking ugandan knuckles fly tanks tank treads mechs good choice players person point view games camera controls set default help people keyboard controls good planes tanks wheels good making meme vehicles good starter bots ones free jam new player advise tier heli copter blades cool strafe ton mobility options hover blades easy use broken fashion overpowered currently place hover blade hover craft float higher solution hovercrafts floating height based center mass instead lowest hover blade different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based tier insect legs bad originally intended use violate carry limit slowly fall wall cling ceilings solution insect bots things use thrusters alot order interested look block widdow hanger factory use keyboard controls hanger demonstrates perfectly want wall clinging turn ceilings block widdow demonstrates want terms clinging ceiling turn fine thrusters pinned wall perfectly like hanger able insect legs reworked camera need reworked allow people better ceilings current weapon balance tier terrifying mega plasma help trusty power module completely destroy robots place accurate attack ground vehicle rail impaler turned away heavy sniper rapid fire precision based weapon mega smg gun fine flak cannon seriously weak loml deals absurd damage replacing flak cannon anti air mortar got nerfed hard know feel started maining got nerfed shotgun ion distorter feels useless weapons balanced way satisfying free jam community robocraft receive anymore weapons feel like everytime weapon introduced nerfed accommodate instead way unsure solutions balance different weapons testing different types bots block spam consider block spam control group position smgs need increased fire rate factory huge risk paid meta started factory war fighters builders fighters obviously win far builders fighters tier goes think bots factory new players experience fighting genuine creative original robots solution irreversible damage regards maps normal gameplay feel like small old maps beginning cool think free jam smaller accommodate smaller player base think needs ro maps maps new gimmicks like parts map time progresses buttons pressed places smaller bots bigger bots travel enclosed cave like maps include darkness use neon cubes headlights reworked version insect legs regards matchmaking casual players competitive players mix think meshed adapt low players game currently game gets player base league mode teirs meshed current tier system regards custom games think private settings mean like allow people random join people host games people search custom game sort menu matchmaking system forged alliance good example movement system adjusted f ma add option custom games enable speed boost community needs stop preaching game dieing turn new players game care fact knows game declining player base loot crates introduced free jam introduces good content player base spikes looking steam charts robocraft damaged reputation hard overcome free jam needs player base needs offer solutions instead game dead community cool lots people willing help new players able access parts easily root problem plagues free jam main center conflict free jam wrestling current lack players solutions think free jam introduce new content weapons great fixes focus fixing problems high quality high rate game flourish content ideas like grapple hook sort swing like grapple hook carry team mates like heli carrying tank pull enemies thank time encourage free jam current community help journey recommend game encourage people try game share views share ideas

557,13277,13281,Tactical Monsters Rumble Arena,"I'm a fan of the SRPG SPORT genre. Pay-to-win (P2W) games can take shape depending on player feedback. I'm going to discuss the game and not grade the player progression aspect or financial model.A warning to new players. If you're not familiar with this game model, some similar titles are Tynon, League of Angels, and Fairy Tail Online. I've played enough of these games to have an expert opinion. Game makers have not yet learned their financial microtransaction model is bad, because it's so new. They're still learning that players *need* all the units in an SRPG FREE to have fair competitive matches, that selling units is bad business because it gives players an unfair advantage they care very strongly about, and that transactions for cosmetics is successful and preferred elsewhere:  e.g. League of Legends skins and The Sims items. (Team leaders could gift unit skins for teamwork or sticking to a code of conduct.) Developers are learning their P2W model creates many dead accounts over time as competitive players quit, while anti-social gambler whales fork out hundreds to be the strongest. I ask you to be patient and tell the developers how you feel about the financial model. Don't just assume they're greedy. Competitive game developers haven't even learned RNG is evil. It's a lot to expect a good business model for this kind of game.Competitive SRPGs need the right stuff to be enjoyable. This is a sport. A player-ranked arena allows players to learn other players' strategies and unit synergies. TMRA has one. Spectating others' battles (recordings) is a must-have too. Unlike other sports, this game genre has yet to adopt seasons -- you're more likely to have competition when the server is new. Cashers later ruin them and force everyone to quit. TMRA appears to have only one ladder and server. TMRA gets points for not having time-restrictive daily grinds or timers to attend. Being able to train units and observe how opponents train (and line up) their units was rather central to Tynon's competitive play, but this is part of having a definitive season system where everyone begins fresh and can make those long-term decisions. (I trained tanks.) Guilds in TMRA are part of player progression, and I don't see any guild war options. Sports need teams and seasons, and the 500 gem cost to form a guild is very unappealing. Guilds are work for the leadership:  you are a coach.I most enjoy defeating stronger players. One way is the tank/healer formation. When HP is a velocity (HP per turn), it's stronger than the attribute alone. This is not typically shown in P2W SRPGs that detail your power level. But trust me when you tank down dozens of big cashers in successive battles and take their city, you get bragging rights. That's what it means to master this kind of game:  epic wins which prove you know what's most powerful. I don't know TMRA has survival battles, but competitive players want them. It's also awesome having a power score which tells you how strong your formation is, even if it's a rough guess. TMRA doesn't have power scoring, player statistics or records yet. Pray together with me.TMRA combat features ranged and melee units of varying attack types (physical vs magical) and special abilities. Units can counterattack, defend and even wait a turn. The formation of your units on the field matters, which it should. You have to protect other units from enemy advancement. I felt the combat diversity is enough to hook me into exploring the game system. Being able to micromanage combat is a plus. You may not be aware other titles automate combat for you. So the potential here is much higher. The tutorials force you to learn unit types and when to take action to obtain perfect 3 star scores.TMRA has a lot of potential as well. Unlike standalone SRPGs, a sport can keep bringing players back. I would buy skins if the developers abandon the P2W model. I've been looking for an honest SRPG competition I can enjoy in my spare time, and win trophies and records in. So for now, TMRA gets my hard-earned thumbs up.

564,3313,3316,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewI could play this game for hours just snowboarding down mountains. Throw in the fact that it feels less sluggish, better optimized and faster paced than PUBG...well, i'm sold. My only major gripe is that at longer ranges (in which a sniper should still be effective) you will see players stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion.

570,15710,15715,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewNOTE: This is a review on the STEAM version of the game and how I feel the game from a PC perspective and not a mobile perspective. There is no difference from the steam version and the mobile version but there are some things that look good on a phone or tablet but not so much on the PC. If this was a review on the mobile version then I would definitetly recommend this game.Now as the game is still open beta, there are many things to be added and polished on (like levels, maps, shops etc) so I can't talk about the lack of content but instead I will mention the things that I feel are weird in the PC or things that should be added or modified.The UI - It shouldn't come to a suprise that when you make a cross platform game between PC and mobile, there are gonna have to be corners cut. In this case its the UI. On mobile, the UI looks great and makes sense but on the PC, it just looks cheap and unclean. Preferably if possible, adding an option to switch between tablet UI and PC UI would be amazing. The UI also lacks alot of small yet needed details like specific HP, MP, and XP numbers.Friends/Party System - While there is an friends list system, there is no party system. You can use the summon code (which is a bit buggy at times. I was stuck in loading) to play on the same channel/map but there isn't a real party system. so you can't see their HP/MP bar without clicking on them. This may not be as big as a problem now but in the future when there are healer classes, it would be extremely difficult to play as you can't attack a monster while keeping tabs on your friends HP at the same time.Weapons/Classes/Stats - There are 4 main stats in the game; HP, MP, Attack, and Defense. The class you have on only affect your skills and nothing else. ""Daggers"" gives the most Attack of all the weapons, ""staffs"" give the most MP, and ""swords"" give the most Defense. Here's the problem. All the classes are equally tanky. I have played all the classes besides Guardian and I have noticed little to no difference in survivability. Being tanky isn't going to help when you're playing a Rogue or Mage because that's not what they do, and Warriors are suppose to be tanky, but do a bad job at it because there are no skills to help him be tanky. In fact, I would say Mage and Rogue are more tanky because they have defensive skills (Mana Sheild and Stealth). This makes Attack the most valuable stat for doing the most damage. AQW was really customizable because there was no restriction on what weapon you could use. You could be a Mage and use a hammer, but this only worked because every weapons attack stats were the same and the attack stats are mainly determined by the enchant. In AQ3D, each weapon has different stats. Attack determines how much damage you do, and that's the only real stat you should be going for as Rogue or Mage. Even Warriors should build this over Defense tbh. ""Daggers"" have the highest attack making the ""daggers"" the only viable weapon to use for high DPS. This takes away a lot of customization (plus it looks weird for a mage to use a dagger as a weapon). Some solutions to this would be adding more stats (like LUK for Rogues and INT for mages) or making it like AQW where all weapons have equal damage and the stat's are based off enchants.Again, this game is still in beta so it is expected to be some flaws but there is a lot of potential in this game. With some things added and polished, I can see this being a very fun game ",0, early access reviewnote review steam version game feel game pc perspective mobile perspective difference steam version mobile version things look good phone tablet pc review mobile version definitetly recommend game game open beta things added polished like levels maps shops etc talk lack content instead mention things feel weird pc things added modified ui come suprise cross platform game pc mobile gon na corners cut case ui mobile ui looks great makes sense pc looks cheap unclean preferably possible adding option switch tablet ui pc ui amazing ui lacks alot small needed details like specific hp mp xp numbers friends party system friends list system party system use summon code bit buggy times stuck loading play channel map real party system hp mp bar clicking big problem future healer classes extremely difficult play attack monster keeping tabs friends hp time weapons classes stats main stats game hp mp attack defense class affect skills daggers gives attack weapons staffs mp swords defense problem classes equally tanky played classes guardian noticed little difference survivability tanky going help playing rogue mage warriors suppose tanky bad job skills help tanky fact mage rogue tanky defensive skills mana sheild stealth makes attack valuable stat damage aqw customizable restriction weapon use mage use hammer worked weapons attack stats attack stats mainly determined enchant weapon different stats attack determines damage real stat going rogue mage warriors build defense tbh daggers highest attack making daggers viable weapon use high dps takes away lot customization plus looks weird mage use dagger weapon solutions adding stats like luk rogues int mages making like aqw weapons equal damage stat based enchants game beta expected flaws lot potential game things added polished fun game
571,5281,5285,Brawlhalla,"There's two kinds of people that write negative reviews on this game:1. People who either have bad internet connection or are unlucky enough to be located near the edge of the world (far from servers)2. Players who can't accept the fact that they are being smashed by lowly spammers and they ramble on about how unfair the game is (it wouldn't be if you got good)There are a few reasons why I would recommend this game. One of which is that you can find really amazing individuals walking around in all game modes (FFA has a significant lack of them, but they can rarely still be seen there). I feel like hitboxes in this game are really fair. You will sometimes get hit by something you wouldn't expect, but you could've known it has a weird hitbox and could've played around it.Whenever something bad happens to you, you could've done something better.

573,1595,1598,Fractured Space,"I used to enjoy playing this game back in the earlier beta stages. Since then, I have grown to dislike the game. Fractured Space went from a ""free to play"" game, to a ""pay to win"" game. Players used to have a level playing field in terms of ships, but now a player can buy implants to make their crew overpowered. Implants can be earned through months or years of grinding for supply drops, or by buying currency and getting the ones one needs. It is truly disapointing to see this game turn to the dark side of ""free to play"" games because I really liked playing this game. I would pay $60 to buy this game, but I will not feed a ""pay to win"" scandel.In addition to the above problem, getting credits in game is incredibly grindy. A player may get 15,000 credits from a match, but it takes upwards form 300,000 to buy a ship. Combine that with the 5+ minute que time, and the player is looking at a wasted day.I personally have had one last issue with this game. I do not know if this happend to any other players, but I had all my ships reset a long time ago, Shortly after they added the black widow I believe. I had owned all of the ships currently in the game and then, I had to grind all the credits to buy new ones.

574,16568,16573,Bloons TD Battles,"The only reason I write this review is that hopefully some change might be done.When I first saw this game coming to steam I was happily suprised, as I am a long timer in this game, playing the mobile version for a very long time and reaching the tops of global leaderboards.The problem I have with this game is not defenetly the quality of the game, or the system the use for microtransactions, which I actually feel is pretty fair. The base problem I have is that the game is stupidly easy once you figure one single tactic. The tactic in question is the Dart/Ninja monkey + anti lead (usually sniper monkey or ninja stun grenades) + banana farm tower combo, with the round 13 regen rainbow rush. For the people that aren't deeply aware of this strategy, let me enlighten you how a normal game could look like: *Placing down dart/ninja monkey*Placing down banana farm*Upgrading towers.*Round 12 sell all your farms and use both powerups.*Round 13 just spam the send for regen 3 rainbow ballons and win.This is litterally all you have to do to have success in this game. Once you do it you WILL find success. Currently my winrate is about 85 percent and all my losses is to other people with the same strategy but they are just slightly faster spamming the Rainbow ballons. This is REALLY bad for the game long term, and is the reason why I abandonned it on mobile despite being among top players in the world. Please now, take care of your game. Use your tools at disposal to nerf this strategy and the game might actually turn out pretty fun and tacticly interessting. This problem isnt new at all, but please do something now.*note: I know they did a slight price nerf to the dart monkey, but it isnt a big deal at all as you have more than enough money from the banana farm to kill your opponent round 13. Simply not a good nerf enough.",0, reason write review hopefully change saw game coming steam happily suprised long timer game playing mobile version long time reaching tops global leaderboards problem game defenetly quality game system use microtransactions actually feel pretty fair base problem game stupidly easy figure single tactic tactic question dart ninja monkey anti lead usually sniper monkey ninja stun grenades banana farm tower combo round regen rainbow rush people deeply aware strategy let enlighten normal game look like placing dart ninja banana sell farms use spam send regen rainbow ballons win litterally success game find success currently winrate percent losses people strategy slightly faster spamming rainbow ballons bad game long term reason abandonned mobile despite players world care game use tools disposal nerf strategy game actually turn pretty fun tacticly interessting problem nt new know slight price nerf dart monkey nt big deal money banana farm kill opponent round simply good nerf

576,8729,8733,Realm Royale,"Early Access Review18 October 2018 - The latest patches seem to be more inline with what most players and I wished. The return of the class based gameplay, more weapons and multiple balance changes (still far from perfect) seem to try to pull this game to a better direction than the patches mentioned in the wall of text underneat.While the patches still have some glitches or bugs, they seem to be trying it to listen to the community feedback and to the fledged player base. Or at least that's what they want to portray.If it is too late to save Realm Royale we will see. At the moment is on the verge of being declared an unnoficial online dead game, but seems to start building some traction yet again. It is far from being what it was in terms of playerwise or balance but is it going somewhere. Q's ar e still long with sometimes 10 minutes Q and only 2 regions (EU/NA). Hit registration with projectile weapons seem to behave worse if you are not playing on your preffered region, even if ping wise it feels the same as before.The direction the game seems to go now could change at any moment, if Hi-Rez decides that this is not racking on the money or the player base.For the moment I will change my review to Recommended to Try. It is not a fully recommended title but if you want a free decent Battle Royale you can get into it.An oppinion from a hardcoring decent Realm Royale PlayerOne of the few BR Games I actualy felt good playing it regularly, competitvely. It was a unique take on Battle Royale that got under the radar for many gamers but I managed to catch it and get involved. While it wasn't for everyone it was something unique that I really enjoyed playing. The playerbase was not really big but you could get matches in a matter of minutes if not seconds. The game even being wacky and sometimes unbalanced or had some what the hell happened there still kept me in and wanting to do play it more.I played PUBG like a lot, but never involved myself in the game, the market or the genre like in Realm Royale. It felt close to perfect experience, downed down by some inconsistencies, slow developing time and too few classes and weapon variety.When I wished for variety I never expected that this is how Realm Royale will become. After some controversial, unnannounced, untested patches went straight to live, or to live after 1 day of existance on PTS I was skeptical about the development cycle, but  afterhuge community backlash, they kind of modified the patch and removed the issues, even if was a bit later than wished.While the gameplay becaim a bit stale in the last patches, people playing metas and the to op engineer, at least for squads, I still enjoyed it and was a blast of fun times and rage times playing with the people on Discord. I still was drawn in.Unfortunately, Erez (CEO of HiRez) decided that Realm Royale is bringing money and it could do even more if they pull in some players. The choice of pulling in some people was made in detrimental to all actual and old Realm Royale players who put money into it, and was also detrimental to the complete Realm Royal formula and to everything the game standed for. Uniqueness. Realm Royale became a complete different game on PTS and now on Live, one that tries to emulate experience from an amalgan of Battle Royale games that have a big number of players actively.While the community complained and tried to provide feedback about what is wrong about the patch and how they should bring the old Realm Royale experience back, or at least try to make some adjustments to the game that is as of now now completely different, HiRez (Erez) decided to push the patch live. The Patch portrayed bugs from previous versions of Realm Royale and even lack of animations or legendary abilities that are or were at the time of writing this broken.Also, Erez CEO of HiRez, recently insulted a high profile if not the highest profile streamer, competitive player of Realm Royale who was commentating in a negative manner about the last patches. Erez posted to the live streamer: ""Play the game the way you are supposed to, with a team and stop crying.""The direction of how this game went from an almost overnight sensation to a decent player base and now to a complete mess, is abysal. While I think that the (old) game could have been decently present in the market with some changes, new content drops and events, now, I am afraid that the game will die before it even gets out of Early Access.The console version has been put on hold, and the duos or solos in the PC Live environment is momentarly a Work in Progress after it has been pulled out of the game, in order to make it more competitive.Queue times are still decent at peak online times when both EU and NA population is live, but when trying to play on EU when EU is on sleep or trying to play on NA when most of NA is away or sleeping is almost impossible with ques taking plus 10 minutes.Also playing from another region (only NA and EU Servers) has a ping that is competitively innefective, especially with the projectile slowed weapons.EU and NA servers are the only one remaining due to low player numbers on the other regions, like South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.Even with one Que (squads) but not being in a popular hour will make your wait for matches.A game who lost a lot of it's playerbase, 94% from the time it launched in Early Access still retained a ~3500 active (concomitent) player count daily, now it struggles to maintain half of that. TLDR:Realm Royale for me and for a lot of players was a game really unique, fun, enjoyable, competitive with few issues in gameplay but some in balance. Still the developers tried to balance the game at much as they could, still ignoring the comments of the playerbase. Was still a decent experience. NOW, Erez (CEO of Hi-Rez) just said a ♥♥♥♥ you to all players and decided to pull out every uniqueness of the game and basically modify the game completely, that only looks similar to what it was before. They tried to bring in more people by borrowing concepts from other games, being more casual and easier to play. They did not achieve nothing, but they managed to drive off their playerbase and attracted no one new, or at least no one to overpass the big ammount of players that left.Realm Royale is a sad exemple of a game that was technically decent and had a unique style getting destroyed by corporate greed, not listening to your playerbase and feedback and shelling Early Access as a motivation to bring in the new changes.Realm Royale is one of the few games that had to change the entire Steam Page to reflect the new changes, and is one of the few games that changed it's entire identity in the course of the Early Access Period, totalizing 3 months at the time of writing.While not popular it still had a population that could make this game last for at least 4-5 months more and with an actual driving force it could have become one of the better Battle Royale games. Now, it's a graveyard. Hopefully, soon, someone will get fired for this disaster and they will pull out the sinking ship. If not, it will go deeper and deeper in the nothingness of time.For what is worth, I am happy for the purchases I made in old Realm Royale. I received cool items, a semi interesting Battle Pass that kept me playing and the tought of supporting the developers of Realm Royale. But I never expected this to happen, even if it is an Early Access. I would have never put money in what Realm Royale is now, even if I would have never played the old Realm Royale.",1, early access october latest patches inline players wished return class based gameplay weapons multiple balance changes far perfect try pull game better direction patches mentioned wall text underneat patches glitches bugs trying listen community feedback fledged player base want portray late save realm royale moment verge declared unnoficial online dead game start building traction far terms playerwise balance going q ar e long minutes q regions eu na hit registration projectile weapons behave worse playing preffered region ping wise feels direction game change moment hi rez decides racking money player base moment change review recommended try fully recommended title want free decent battle royale oppinion hardcoring decent realm royale playerone br games actualy felt good playing regularly competitvely unique battle royale got radar gamers managed catch involved unique enjoyed playing playerbase big matches matter minutes seconds game wacky unbalanced hell happened kept wanting play played pubg like lot involved game market genre like realm royale felt close perfect experience downed inconsistencies slow developing time classes weapon variety wished variety expected realm royale controversial unnannounced untested patches went straight live live day existance pts skeptical development cycle afterhuge community backlash kind modified patch removed issues bit later wished gameplay becaim bit stale patches people playing metas op engineer squads enjoyed blast fun times rage times playing people discord drawn unfortunately erez ceo hirez decided realm royale bringing money pull players choice pulling people detrimental actual old realm royale players money detrimental complete realm royal formula game standed uniqueness realm royale complete different game pts live tries emulate experience amalgan battle royale games big number players actively community complained tried provide feedback wrong patch bring old realm royale experience try adjustments game completely different hirez erez decided push patch live patch portrayed bugs previous versions realm royale lack animations legendary abilities time writing broken erez ceo hirez recently insulted high profile highest profile streamer competitive player realm royale commentating negative manner patches erez posted live streamer play game way supposed team stop crying direction game went overnight sensation decent player base complete mess abysal think old game decently present market changes new content drops events afraid game die gets early access console version hold duos solos pc live environment momentarly work progress pulled game order competitive queue times decent peak online times eu na population live trying play eu eu sleep trying play na na away sleeping impossible ques taking plus minutes playing region na eu servers ping competitively innefective especially projectile slowed weapons eu na servers remaining low player numbers regions like south america africa asia australia que squads popular hour wait matches game lost lot playerbase time launched early access retained active concomitent player count daily struggles maintain half tldr realm royale lot players game unique fun enjoyable competitive issues gameplay balance developers tried balance game ignoring comments playerbase decent experience erez ceo hi rez said players decided pull uniqueness game basically modify game completely looks similar tried bring people borrowing concepts games casual easier play achieve managed drive playerbase attracted new overpass big ammount players left realm royale sad exemple game technically decent unique style getting destroyed corporate greed listening playerbase feedback shelling early access motivation bring new changes realm royale games change entire steam page reflect new changes games changed entire identity course early access period totalizing months time writing popular population game months actual driving force better battle royale games graveyard hopefully soon fired disaster pull sinking ship deeper deeper nothingness time worth happy purchases old realm royale received cool items semi interesting battle pass kept playing tought supporting developers realm royale expected happen early access money realm royale played old realm royale

578,6378,6382,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewWith every update the grind feels like it stretches out longer and longer. Expect to spend several days of gameplay to unlock that next weapon or vehicle, as ""repair"" fees tacked onto every action you take in-game cut into what few credits you earn.Paid content doesn't get you much further. Purchasing in-game gold gives you very little for your money. It would feel completely like a ""pay to win"" game if it did, but the truth is that paying players are stuck with almost all of the same absurdly long grind as the rest of us. It should be telling that despite coming up on almost 1000 hours of play, I have unlocked only 1/3rd of the items, classes, and vehicles in the game. And that's not drawing from a very large pool of unlockables.The weapons are *not* fairly balanced in the slightest. Everyone starts with a semi-auto rifle which is trash, before unlocking a SMG that is unusable at range, but decent up close. Next they'll unlock higher tier SMGs which are still bad at range, but great up close. A bolt action rifle, once (EXPENSIVELY) upgraded to a one-hit kill, is a huge upgrade. Assault rifles make SA rifles obsolete. LMGs manage to be even better than assault rifles (T2 US and German LMGs are absurdly strong).Despite all the problems it has, H&G is built on a fantastic game engine, which manages to feel open world and well paced despite all of the balance problems you'll encounter.

585,7399,7403,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I've always been a fan of card games but this one is very punishing to new players. The short end of it is, when you start the game everyone else has better cards than you and for the most part, even if you outplay them and make good decisions, their cards are just significantly stronger than yours so they outvalue what you have. Arena is okay because it takes most of this away but then again it seems like people get more legendaries and rares than you do in arena. I'm almost level 30 and I still lose around 75% of my games. The only ""fair"" matches I seem to have are against new players like myself who don't have an extensive collection of cards. I don't think this game is bad, but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other players. I also mostly play casual where I get matched up against people who have been playing for a very long time so that may be different than if I played ranked. I love watching youtubers like CVH and justinlarson play this game and how creative they can be when crafting decks but then I realize that it's ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when I have such a minimal collection. Maybe in time I'll get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beating players who've been around for a long time but until then, I'm going to continually lose all of my games unless I'm playing against new players or long-time players using trolly decks.Edit: Invested even more time into the game and it's still pay-to-win. After 100+ hours I still lose to everyone because they have better cards.

586,7818,7822,Trove,"With almost 300 hours on this game, and my first ever Steam review. I can firmly say that this game is absolutely fun to play, however, unless you're willing to put much of your free time into this game, you won't go far. It's not a game for people who just want to pick this game up and play it. You need to invest time ( or money : Will talk about this in a bit ).

588,14766,14771,Robocraft,"UPDATED 24/11/18: Its been a while... and rc is still utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ That sums it up. If you're an old robocraft (2015) fan, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. Dont be fooled by recent reviews saying the tech tree is back etc. Its hardly like the older one. The Equivalent to T10 games are nothing like what they used to be. TDM is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ respawn fest with everything dumbed down and sped up. Theres no teamplay whatsover because respawns and self healing are a thing so medics are completely redundant. Absolute waste of your time if you decide is try this again.//Older review:Ask me for a review on this before Respawned and Overclocked update? (30/04/15) I would give this a positive review BUT AFTER Resspawned and Overclocked update....... That's a whole new side....Here's why-Before Respawned and Overclocked, this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking, sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode. Once dead, you're gone. Once they introduced medics; it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together. Moreover, when FJ released the team balance patch, the battles would last sooooo much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldn't be paired with 5 other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of smg tanks. As medic you would feel so valuable; one of my favourite memories...Megabots arrive. Some of the player base decides this was a bad move (this was where the game started to get controversial) however, in my opinion, this was even better because now the T10's would stick by the Mega's siding them in one big turf war. Those were the good days of RC.30th of April arrives. Respawned and Overclocked. The danger of dying now gone; stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using tri forcing ect. Team work is gone; no need to stick together. If you die, you can just respawn again. Don't even get me started on medics... Before Respawned and Overclocked, medics were the top priority on kill list. But now they're just replaced with respawn. Again, no fear of dying. Megabots are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new Respawned and Overclocked. (The megabots were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned). Even though arena mode is still here, it feels as if it gets no love anymore.Robocraft Unleashed touches down. The removals of tiers and tech trees are here. This resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that it's no longer the case. In addition, going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression. I can see FJ wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just won't work.To some up-Robocraft used to be one of my favourite games and WAS a fun and enjoyable game. Simple and easy to learn. However, as the updates passed, Robocraft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed 'moba' style game...ps: if you read all of this; thanks for your time!",0, updated rc utter sums old robocraft fan love god stay away game nt fooled recent reviews saying tech tree etc hardly like older equivalent games like tdm respawn fest dumbed sped s teamplay whatsover respawns self healing thing medics completely redundant absolute waste time decide try review ask review respawned overclocked update positive review resspawned overclocked update new respawned overclocked game inspired team work revolving heavy flanking sticking big cluster brute force arena type mode dead gone introduced medics revolutionised battle mechanic team succeed perish reinforcing team staying fj released team balance patch battles sooooo longer adrenalin filled paired rail walkers crushed team smg tanks medic feel valuable favourite memories megabots arrive player base decides bad game started controversial opinion better stick mega siding big turf war good days april arrives respawned overclocked danger dying gone stupid bots start appearing virtually killing cleverly thought designs tri forcing ect team work gone need stick die respawn started medics respawned overclocked medics priority kill list replaced respawn fear dying megabots restricted old mode hardly played shiny new respawned overclocked megabots fairly new work abandoned arena mode feels gets love anymore robocraft unleashed touches removals tiers tech trees resulted huge backlash community veterans felt progress took ages grind tier save new parts find longer case addition going tier feel amazing satisfied giving sense progression fj wanted enable creativity wanted wo work robocraft favourite games fun enjoyable game simple easy learn updates passed robocraft got complicated destroying fun simple factors arena game mode supposed moba style game ps read thanks time

I know it is still in BETA so there would be updates and stuff.So as the time went they added new stuff, which was cool. But then the updates werent really updates...but downgrades. With every single one, the game got worse and worse. Constantly messing up with the stats of vehicles and weapons just got ridiculous. Even though the developers claimed they wanted to have each faction different sort of gear, good and bad, they started to mess things up so in the end it doesnt really matter what side you are playing, its the same.The worst thing is that this game became PAY TO WIN. So if you are not willing to sink hundreds of dollars into a computer game, dont install it. After the last update the prices went triple and possibility to earn credits in game was reduced by half. Another funny thing is that the developers claim there is ""5 million players"" Well there is at MAX 10 thousand online every time, so i guess the total amount of active players cant be higher than 100k..which is  1/50 of what they claimTo conclude it, it gets worse and worse with every update.

611,9065,9069,PlanetSide 2,"Great first person shooter with massive maps and massive battles with potentially hundreds of players on each side.  There are 3 factions: VanuSovereignity, NeoConglomerate and TerrainRepublic. VS are sci-fi style with hovertank and plasma weapons. Their weaponry is mixed. NC are mercenaries with gauss weapons. Their main battletank is closest to normal tank. They have heavy emphasis towards shotguns. TR are ""the empire"". They use regular weaponry and tend to have large clips on their weapons. Their main battletank has 2 barrels. The best quality of PS2 is that its sandbox styled. You can do what ever you want. If you like to play with other people you can join someone's squad or start your own (quality of playing with squad depends on 75% leader and 25% members in my opinion). You can go solo and still be part of large battles, take potshots at the fringes or even infiltrate enemy bases and cause havoc there.Planetside 2 is free to play, so you can use real money to buy stuff. However, everything that actually affects gameplay can be unlocked by playing within reasonable amount of time. You can trial any weapon for 1h per day. Most weapons are sidegrades and most stock weapons are actually quite good. Having large arsenal means that you can tackle wider variety of situations.

Eternal is imho the best F2P CCG out there. Two things really shine here. The generous reward system with upgradable chests and the Draft system where you get to keep all your picks.Game modes vs AI Campaign: Introduces you to the game and mechanics. Also gets you some cards. Gauntlet: Choose your own deck and play vs the AI and earn better rewards. Forge: Build a deck of 25 cards by picking from 3 cards each time. Play vs the AI and earn better rewards.Game modes multiplayer Events: Special periodic events with prizes and leaderboard. Build an 'x' themed deck and play vs others. Casual: Choose your own deck and play vs humans. Ranked: Choose your own deck and play vs humans. Laddering system (bronze, silver, gold, diamond and master) Draft: Build a deck of 45 cards by opening 4 packs and picking 1 card then passing the pack. You get to keep all your picks.Daily QuestsThere are also quests which will give you rewards like 2 silver chests or 1 gold chest upon completion. Like ""Win 2 vs Games in a row"" or ""Play 10 Flying units"".Rewards systemThe reward system comes in the form of chests. Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond chests. One of the best things about this game is that when opening a chest you have a 10% chance to get a better chest. That first time opening a silver chest that gets upgraded to a Gold chest is FeelsGoodMan. Getting a single chest upgraded multiple times is also possible. Bronze > Silver > Gold > Diamond chest.

617,10866,10870,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI started playing Magic the Gathering back in middle school and continued through highschool.  Unfortunately once I graduated and my group of friends moved on, I gave up the game.  Our group was never competative (I'm sure most of us never realized that Magic tournaments existed), we just played the game to have fun.I learned that Magic Online was a thing that existed shortly after it released, but learning of the pricing scheme there was no way I was going to get involved with it (and this is coming from someone that was willing to pay a monthly subscription to MMO's).  It just seemed rediculous to me to pay for digital cards...when they weren't actually collectables in my mind.  PC gaming was always my main hobby even during my Magic years, and quite frankly there are TONS of PC games better than what Magic offers.Fast forward to today and Eternal.The game has everything that Magic should offer to a player.  It has an excellent Deck building system that lets you quickly and easily sort your collection even as new cards are added.  It has a variety of game modes, including both Competative and non-competative options which is very important for me as I need to be in the right mood to want to play vs. another player.  It has great characters and an interesting setting that stands out from other games.  But the most important thing Eternal has is fun.The game is FUN.I really appreciate how the developer (DWD) has taken the time to realize that they aren't creating just a card game.  They are making a Computer game.  They have taken the solid foundation that Magic has built and turned that into a game that is actually modernized for play in the Internet Era.Each game takes ~5-7minutes usually and with how they have structured their game modes and rewards, you still feel like you are making progress towards earning new cards even if that one game is all you have time for.  If you are playing one of the modes versus an AI opponent, you can even leave mid-game and come back later if required.The most recent (Aug 2017) feature added was an excellent puzzle mode, which to me harkens back to Scrye or Inquest ""what's the play"" puzzles.  Even though I have been playing the game for about a year I was surprised how many ""tips for new players"" they were able to add into the puzzle mode to give you a little bit of a strategic level up after coming out of the tutorial.  I am so happy I found this game and honestly very excited for its future.  An account long-term progression mode is coming soon and I am interested to see what that offers.",1, early access reviewi started playing magic gathering middle school continued highschool unfortunately graduated group friends moved gave game group competative sure realized magic tournaments existed played game fun learned magic online thing existed shortly released learning pricing scheme way going involved coming willing pay monthly subscription mmo rediculous pay digital cards actually collectables mind pc gaming main hobby magic years frankly tons pc games better magic offers fast forward today eternal game magic offer player excellent deck building system lets quickly easily sort collection new cards added variety game modes including competative non competative options important need right mood want play player great characters interesting setting stands games important thing eternal fun game appreciate developer dwd taken time realize creating card game making computer game taken solid foundation magic built turned game actually modernized play internet era game takes usually structured game modes rewards feel like making progress earning new cards game time playing modes versus ai opponent leave mid game come later required recent aug feature added excellent puzzle mode harkens scrye inquest play puzzles playing game year surprised tips new players able add puzzle mode little bit strategic level coming tutorial happy found game honestly excited future account long term progression mode coming soon interested offers
618,4430,4434,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"ABSOLUTE P2W GAME! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! ONLINE GAMBLING FOR KIDS!The ""Fur Hire"" and ""Spellbook"" and the ""Rampage Forest"" decks are so overpowered that you are guaranteed to lose in 1-3 turns because of how gamebreaking they are. This is an obvious Pay-For-Power where if you don't buy these witch cash you are given the worst card RNG imaginable where it requires literally no skill to win because you can literally summon 3 monsters in one single turn with additional effects where you are guaranteed to lose. If you are a parent keep your kids away from this game otherwise you will be finding yourself with ridiculous microtransactions on your bill.Konami should be indicted for literally introducing online gambling to children. Because anyone who claims that this game isn't rigged you are delusional or an idiot. The abilities themselves literally control what cards you are able to draw. You are better off buying physical cards instead and playing in person because Konami can't rig your card shuffling. This is how they trick kids into putting money into their game. Because not only do you have to buy the most OP decks they make sure they place F2P players against you so you can get that mental rush like you are somehow good at the game influencing you to buy more when they introduce even more OP decks. It's an endless cycle.I put in about 100+ hours on android and I knew that it was P2W from the start. They rig the cards you draw. I literally filled it with mostly monsters and only drew only my spell cards in a row. I had 50% monsters and 50% spells/traps and literally kept getting only spells or only monsters. I even made it 70% monsters and 30% spells/traps and STILL got nothing but spells somehow. I was only using the Peak Performance skill the entire time.I even put multiple copies of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicates. I even experimented my card draws with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful cards which were always conveniently placed at the very bottom of my deck. I have mostly played with my friends and they literally saw it on my livestream that I would draw similar cards during my 1st or 2nd turn and we even played about 30-40 matches in a row only to happen every single time.They even rigged the dice roll cards to give you the worst dice rolls as much as possible as they are powerful and would allow you to stand a chance against the P2W decks. It goes against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for using the right cards at the right moment. I have the Dangerous Machine Type-6 and it LITERALLY gave me a #6 dice roll 18 times in a row across all my matches always self-destructing my card each time. I only got to use it to it's full effect only 2 times and the rest was nothing but 1 or 6.I mostly played with my friends and even when they had cards more powerful than mine I have won more matches against them. This just proves how massively rigged the RNG system is and did my own personal research. The math doesn't make any sense and pretty much forces you to buy the most OP decks behind the paywall. If you are F2P be prepared to lose a lot of matches and do a ton of grinding to unlock ""skills"". If you don't believe that the card draws are rigged they literally have a feature called ""skills"" that can be applied to your character.How is this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain cards out of their butt that completely breaks the game. What a joke! Here is a list of the so-called ""skills"" that can be activated below.BalanceIf your deck consists of 10 monster cards and 10 spell/trap cards, you will have 2 monster and 2 spell/trap in starting hand.Draw Sense: Spell/TrapCan be used each time your Life Points decrease by 1800.

625,1939,1942,Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a first person MMO RPG survival horror game developed by EA and EA only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate ""prologue"" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of Россия... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to ""show her the world"" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue!The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall!

630,10756,10760,Eternal Card Game,"Card Game is for sure MY favorite digital Collectible/Trading Card Game (CCG/TCG). It's super free-to-play friendly and you consistently get free packs & cards over time. Even in the beginning, you don't feel like you are completely outmatched just because someone has rarer cards in their deck than you. You can play ""budget"" decks (see https://eternalwarcry.com/decks?dn=budget) and still win with a good strategy.It's a bit closer to Magic the Gathering (MTG) than simpler card games like Hearthstone and Shadowverse in that you still draw power cards rather than gain power evenly each turn, but there are a lot more mechanics compared to MTG that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power. It's also more like MTG in that it's more complex than the other digital CCG options out there. One major benefit over MTG is that this is strictly a digital game, so you have fun mechanics that would be very hard to pull off for MTG since that still has to cater to a physical card game. For example, stats on ""killed"" units remain even if the card returns from the ""void.""Just recently (Dec 2018), a new set of cards has come out that has really added to the deck-building options. It feels like the popular decks are always changing and you have many different options with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck isn't always the winner.You are definitely rewarded for playing against other players, but, especially in the beginning and after a new set is released, playing against the AI is fun and gives you a lot of cards. The reason is that when you draft cards, unlike other games, they are permanently added to your deck. How cool is that?Definitely try it. It's free-to-play and you NEVER feel pressured to put money into the game. You can play on iOS, Android, Steam, & Xbox and they are always kept in sync and all rewards are available on all platforms. Achievements sync too (except Xbox). PvP play is cross-platform.Note that you get a free preconstructed deck by using a referral code to sign up (I don't want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you found my review helpful; I'd appreciate it). That said, don't feel bad if you didn't get the deck. You can get all those cards fairly quickly even if you don't use a referral link.The game does make you play the first six or so games of the tutorial, but after that you can skip the tutorial from the settings menu if you don't want to complete it. Also check out Reddit for a really cool community and more information. There are also a couple links there to free promotions that get a free campaign. You can also get other campaigns by spending in-game currency that you gain just by playing; as I said, you don't have to pay anything. There are some extra visual items that you can purchase (deck backs, etc.), but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they are strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and/or support the developers. Even without spending money, new cosmetic options are available to you fairly often.Again, the current player-base would love to see the community grow. Many players are very pro and competitive, but are great to learn from and super friendly. I am more casual, but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game. I also feel the art style is really cool without being too weird, gross, or overtly sexualized.

634,7510,7514,Trove,"When this game first came out, it was amazing so much do it in the game.But that's when the game first came out. Whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours. I'll go into more detail on the CONS near the end.PROS:-Great fun with friends if you're all new to the game!-The massive range of items in the game-How they submit workshop creations into the game-They keep updating this game and adding more content e.g. new classes!-This game is ""Free 2 Play""CONS:-The grinding in this game is stupidly long.-In-game purchases-Quickly gets boring if you're a casual playerOkay, the reason why i'm not going to be going into the PROS into more detail as they're self explained from my view. But i'll be going over the CONS as quite a large range of people who've played this game have encountered this problem as i have.First CON: The grinding. If you're a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is. This CON is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end. Okay, once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first 4 hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid.Second CON: With the in-game purchases this is completely optional, but what the in-game purchases give you are quite stupid. But the in-game purchases you don't have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see alot of reviews saying ""Pay 2 Play"". In my opinion i don't see the game as ""Pay 2 Play"" as i haven't spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from.Third CON: If you're a casual player like me, you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take ALOT of your time e.g. the grinding in this game. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added (which i think a few have encountered) i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game.My Final Opinion.I recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isn't a bad thing. What i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it'll help the game progression for players which don't have the sort of time like others.Thank you for reading my review.

635,12346,12350,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewContent:Lacking at best with a meh story. You quest till 13, then grind a dungeon 10 levels at a time until you do a few quests to get to the next dungeon. There is actually 0 endgame content, and PvP is a joke for anyone besides mages and rangers (the only two classes that can actually hit people).Gameplay:The combo system is fine but you have to completely rebind all the keys because they're all over the place by default. It's pretty much a hack n slash with no difficult enemies, (I mean you can literally solo the first 2 dungeons), so it's not interesting at all. Also, have fun running out of stamina on your mount every 5 minutes.Technical issues:The whole game is a technical issue. From horrible optimization (I have a Titan XP and the top Intel I7 CPU - still struggling to keep it smooth at 1080p), to horrible translations, with random buggy interactions such as items never respawning, NPCs never respawning, not being able to loot, getting frozen, not being able to exit combat OR log out, and not being able to enter dungeons because you got a random dungeon CD (unexplained WHY you got the CD).Wouldn't recommend to anyone.

653,3978,3982,Team Fortress 2," The meet your match update.      I met my match alright, because I can't stand this horrible update.          I've been a long time player, been here since the Replay Update back in may of 2011, and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me.      The biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. Say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! You're done!  Nope, with the newest EPIC CONTENT UPDATE, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode'    Casual mode      Now casual mode is its own can of worms. During the launch of this update, you couldn't even CHOOSE THE MAP YOU WANTED TO PLAY ON. You picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. Some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. It goes something like this:1. Choose the map and mode you wish to play2. Enter the que and wait up to 5 minutes to get into a game3. Join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server4. The map ends, everyone disconnects5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you die of old age     You might be thinking ""just go play on community servers!"" If by ""community servers"" you mean ""only 2fort/dustbowl"" then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. But for a game with 92 different maps spanning across 15 game modes, I think I'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there.      There are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't I play on some of them? Mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or AMAZING trade servers. I hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about 9 billion of them to choose from!      I live on the east coast of America and mainly play at night. I can hardly ever find a match with 20 players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/2fort. This is unnacceptable. Where the hell are all the 50k players at?   Competitive Mode      I don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. Personally I believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had had this mode added. This is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right?      Wrong.      As far as I know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. Plenty of time to polish some of its features up. But yet again, Valve somehow managed to screw it up.      No class restrictions, telephone number REQUIRED or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards.      No class restricitions is self explanatory. You can have about 6 engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. Now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but If you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue.      The telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to Valve?      Cough up that $10 buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club.      Now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. Banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. Instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve 130-damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update).      Last but not least, no real rewards. Valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. They could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level 10 or even level 18. But instead, you get nothing. You upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot.    In conclusion       tldr this update sucks and I advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again       This is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it.",0, meet match update met match alright stand horrible update long time player replay update absolute favorite game time update finally nail coffin biggest glaring issue removal valve servers want play match sawmill maybe map popular lumberyard normally bring browser narrow search map want find valve server healthy players good ping boom nope newest epic content update servers removed replaced casual mode casual mode casual mode worms launch update choose map wanted play picked game mode pressed button shoved que extrememly long waiting time things fixed experience hardly better goes like choose map mode wish enter que wait minutes join server sided stomp ends faster time took join map ends repeat steps die old age thinking play community servers community servers mean dustbowl sure play hearts content game different maps spanning game modes think right wanting little bit diversity servers course fact play mainly garbage custom servers amazing trade servers hope like custom maps modes especially minecraft ones billion choose live east coast america mainly play night hardly find match good ping stock maps unnacceptable hell players competitive mode play competitive frankly personally believe game competitive mode added main point update amazing right wrong far know mode beta half year maybe plenty time polish features valve managed screw class restrictions telephone number required spend money weapon restrictions real rewards class restricitions self explanatory engineers snipers spies team wanted bad thing se plan playing competitive solo half team gibus spies issue telephone number restriction helps combat trolls griefers people telephone number want away personal contact information valve cough buddy toll admission want join competitive club weapon restrictions honestly kill mode banning broken weapons level playing field instead access mini crits demand cola reserve damage blowbacking target shooter way valve planned buffing update real rewards valve aware vast majority playerbase going play competitive win rank badge outside competitive mode added fancy new weapon skins exclusive cosmetics compensate gut wrenching grind level level instead upgrade badge different picture lot conclusion tldr update sucks advise stay away game update casual feel like valve servers long review meme sentence game special place heart deserves comes
654,9105,9109,PlanetSide 2,"PlanetSide 2 is a very interesting F2P MMOFPS. If there was a ""mixed"" review option, this is where I would use it. But now looking back towards its first year when it launched (which you can find the player counts here[steamcharts.com]) compared to what it is now, I simply can't recommend this game anymore due to not having that much of a stable playerbase anymore. As usual with (somewhat) older games, the more skilled players only tend to play the game now with the acception of newer players trying it out. I've known numerous players who want to get into the game yet struggle when the veteran players seems to dominate in every way possible. Take Quake Live for example, the small community there tends to just be veterans of the game which makes it very hard for people to get into the game.But not everyone is like that, though. I have myself for that example as I started playing PS2 halfway through its lifespan before quitting around BR55-65. Thus meaning it is very much possible to catch up to higher skilled players. This isn't including how oddly optimized this game is as it seems to bottleneck or straight up lag most of the time unless you have an extremely overkill computer.TL;DR Low player base, sluggish optimization, and not a very easy game to get into (for most).",0, planetside interesting mmofps mixed review option use looking year launched find player counts compared simply recommend game anymore having stable playerbase anymore usual somewhat older games skilled players tend play game acception newer players trying known numerous players want game struggle veteran players dominate way possible quake live example small community tends veterans game makes hard people game like example started playing halfway lifespan quitting meaning possible catch higher skilled players including oddly optimized game bottleneck straight lag time extremely overkill computer low player base sluggish optimization easy game

659,7870,7874,Trove,"Mindless fun-- appeals to the collector in me. It's a serious grind, and aggressively monetized. Unless you want to play for six months just to reach current ""endgame"", you'll have to drop a decent amount of cash. Trove started off as a game where you essentially didn't have to pay a dime, and the devs were upfront about the fact that this initial business model made it very difficult for them to make money. So around February 2016, they started to monetize the game hardcore. The cheapest packs were $20-- and that was in addition to a $15 a month subscription. With the introduction of the Mantle of Power expansion, they added such an extreme element of RNG to the game via the gem system that it seemed impossible to advance without either crazy luck, or ridiculous amounts of cash. The outcry from the playerbase was severe, and over the past couple of months, Trion has dialed back the RNG and monetization. There's still plenty of it, don't get me wrong-- but a lot of concerns have been addressed, and now they've started to offer $5 packs. And with the upcoming push to consoles, I think the game is going to get a second wind of content.All in all, this game was rough for a while, but it's slowly getting back to a satisfying place. For those of us who love simple action combat, collecting, building, and mindless grinding, Trove is magic. But if you want progression in any reasonable amount of time, prepare to drop AT LEAST the $15 a month for a sub. Anything less and you'll be playing until the end of time without ever catching up. The packs aren't completely crucial, but being willing to buy one or two a month will definitely put you in a better place. If you don't want to spend a dime, ever, then this is not the game for you. But if you try it and love it enough to want to invest in it, the way you would a hobby, then Trove will be an immensely fulfilling experience.",1, mindless appeals collector grind aggressively monetized want play months reach current endgame drop decent cash trove started game essentially pay dime devs upfront fact initial business model difficult money february started monetize game hardcore cheapest packs addition month subscription introduction mantle power expansion added extreme element rng game gem system impossible advance crazy luck ridiculous amounts cash outcry playerbase severe past couple months trion dialed rng monetization plenty lot concerns addressed started offer packs upcoming push consoles think game going second wind content game rough slowly getting satisfying place love simple action combat collecting building mindless grinding trove magic want progression reasonable time prepare drop month sub playing end time catching packs completely crucial willing buy month definitely better place want spend dime game try love want invest way hobby trove immensely fulfilling experience

663,10286,10290,theHunter Classic,"Don't get me wrong, I love ths game, BUT...Added: 07/09/2018Cheaters are getting less but still not enough is being done. In-game reporting tool is still missing. Support is slightly better but general lack of comms about long-term plans for the game makes many players jittery.The game hasn't evolved much in the last 3 years due to the ageing engine it runs on.It's still not FTP in the true sense of the term compared to other games e.g. Fishing Planet where the complete game is accessible albeit through a slow grind.Added: 04/11/2017Firstly, this game has a tremendous number of cheaters. What really twists my testicles is that the onus lie with us players to inform EW of hackers. They do not even bother to apply some basic logic to hunting trips (a simple factor/formula based on information that they already gather) to identify and catch the most blatant of cheaters.Every time these bloody hackers steal our trophies and chances of winning em$, and yet the company does nothing about it. I reckon it's simple economics, and as long as the cheaters buy into the game, the company won't do jackshit. What a rip-off! I’m tired of doing their bloody police work for them. WAKE UP, SMELL THE BLOODY COFFEE AND LOOK AFTER THE DECENT FOLK.Secondly, the level of support is not what you would expect from any software company. You got an issue? Sorry, everyone's on holiday. Come back on Wednesday. I reckon they get away with this hiding behind the FTP banner and running their company like a family-owned business as appose to a proper game/software development company. Now, these are things you as a gamer don't know before you buy into the game, but believe me, them niggly things (lack of support, timely support, quality of support and ongoing bugs) add up after a while and prevent this good game from becoming a great game, and oh boy, does it have the potential!My Original Review:Addictive? Yes. Overpriced? YesWill I continue to pay for overpriced gear? Probably not. There's no reward for people investing hundreds of dollars into the game, zilch, zero - apart from enjoying a hunting game with what little gear you can afford. Also, most missions are free up until the time that you need a particular gun to proceed i.e. give us your money. So far....it's a love / hate relationship, like a $1000/hr hooker that you can't get enough of. Not that I would know.For the time being I'll mark it as - Not recommended.

671,16331,16336,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Personally, I didn't enjoy this game. Rather, it was more of a pain to play than fun. When I disassembled the AK-47 and M1911, they were so cool and very introcate. I enjoyed that bit, but then they introduced this EXP system where I had to earn EXP by doing moreâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥with the guns I've already destroyed. Then on top of that, there's literally banners featuring their DLC for this game. At first, I thought I'd give this EXP system a go, but then it instantly backfired on me because the tutorial was forcing me to do ""games"" with said AK-47 where I'd have to COMPLETELY disassemble the ENTIRE weapon as fast as I could with no hints. Must I remind you that this was litearlly no more than 30 minutes of gameplay before they instantly expected me to remember how to completely disassemble the weapon and do it as fast as possible. This was just a nightmare for me because they added in EVEN MORE PARTS TO DISASSEMBLE, WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CONFUSED. Oh, and did I mention that the AK-47 is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to disassemble? If it were with the pistol, I would have been A LOT more comfortable, but no, they just HAD to stick me with the hardest weapon in the game to disassemble.Look, if you're a guns expert and are too poor to buy real games on Steam, then this is the PERFECT game for you. If you're a casual gamer who knows a FEW things about guns, then no, go away, you're going to have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing brain injury before you're done finishing this game. Maybe it's because I'm impatient, but I'd rather have every single weapon there and already unlocked so that I could just shoot them, disassemble them, play with them on the fly instead of going through their 10 hour long tutorial and having to waste even more time on the exact same weapons that I've already got done with just to unlock more weapons.",0, personally enjoy game pain play fun disassembled cool introcate enjoyed bit introduced exp system earn exp moreâ guns destroyed literally banners featuring dlc game thought exp system instantly backfired tutorial forcing games said completely disassemble entire weapon fast hints remind litearlly minutes gameplay instantly expected remember completely disassemble weapon fast possible nightmare added parts disassemble confused oh mention â disassemble pistol lot comfortable stick hardest weapon game disassemble look guns expert poor buy real games steam perfect game casual gamer knows things guns away going â brain injury finishing game maybe impatient single weapon unlocked shoot disassemble play fly instead going hour long tutorial having waste time exact weapons got unlock weapons

682,2038,2041,Path of Exile,"If you enjoyed Diablo 2, you will enjoy this. If you loved Diablo 2, you will love this. I think Diablo 3 is fun, but a little less difficult than this game. Path of Exile really puts you on the spot every time you go somewhere. You make a mistake on this hostile island full of murderous creatures and evil beings, and boom. You die. GGG's alternative to ""end-game"" content is pretty interesting too, even though I haven't reached that point yet, and they encourage people to try new things with their ever-changing Seasonal Events, and Races. Rewards just for playing them, no pay-to-win, and plenty of friendly people in-game makes for pretty happy players.UPDATE TO REVIEW: I have since reached endgame content and by all that is ♥♥♥♥ing holy this game is amazing.Far better with friends, too. Since most people like to do so, here's a Pros and Cons setup:Pros:+ Gameplay: Like I described above, the game feels ultimately rather similar to Diablo in how it is played, until you get into the real meat and potatoes of it, somewhere usually around level 30-35 or so.+ Community: The community is amazing. Sure, we'll mess with people and provide peanut gallery level commentary on everything (hell, one of my characters is named ""Cactus_Chucker"" for god's sakes) but we also help out players who are legitimately just asking questions, or learning aspects of the game for the first time. Everyone started somewhere, and not all of us have ~800 hours.+ NOT PAY TO WIN: Grinding Gear Games has absolutely nothing functional that you can pay for aside from storage space. Considering that storage space does not affect your characters in any way, shape, or form in how they are played, how their damage is calculated, or anything, the game cannot be classified as pay to win. Just pay to look dope as ♥♥♥♥ and have all the shiny things stashed away where they'll never see the light of day.+ Co-Op: You can play with friends! It is free! Invite your friends and show them the glory of PUNCHING THINGS SO HARD THEY EXPLODE! (Infernal Blow Facebreakers)+ Hardware Limitations: I run this game on an 8 year old HP laptop. Obviously that means that it isn't super hardware intensive. Makes it easier to play with friends who aren't as up to date on their tech.Cons:- Connection Required: Yeah, this is kind of annoying. Being online at all times makes this kind of a hassle if there are things happening like inclement weather, or other things like repairs on hardware in your area. Not a huge con, but still worth mentioning.- Desync: This one is mostly a ""new player"" problem, and is easily fixed. By changing your connection settings in the Main Menu (note: CANNOT BE DONE WHILE IN GAME, MUST BE DONE BEFORE SELECTING A CHARACTER) under Input from ""Predictive"" to ""Lockstep"". Basically changes from ""game assumes where you will be, reacts from there"" to ""client tells game where you are, game reacts from there"".

This game was a lot of fun way back when it just came out of beta and before all of the major updates, which in turn ruined the game in my opinion.      I truly love this game, from playing with friends to just farming by myself, this game is a blast. Although this game is very repetitive, the outcome to what you're grinding for eventually pays off and you feel a sense of satisfaction- but that feeling goes away as soon as you see that you have to farm and spend hours upon hours to get anywhere in the game. Most of the hours that I have logged were back before the update of the game where they introduced gems and they started to make items untradable, meaning you can't trade them with players and you had to get items yourself rather than trading for them, which was a core part of this game since the start of Trove. I still log into this game from time to time to see if anything is different, and to see if I can do anything in a timely manner. I do not suggest this game because of the time that it takes for the player to get anywhere in the game, and the extent that you have to grind for the items that you want.",0, review based current time game hours total game lot fun way came beta major updates turn ruined game opinion truly love game playing friends farming game blast game repetitive outcome grinding eventually pays feel sense feeling goes away soon farm spend hours hours game hours logged update game introduced gems started items untradable meaning trade players items trading core game start trove log game time time different timely manner suggest game time takes player game extent grind items want

689,13216,13220,Fallout Shelter,"(First review.)Not a fast game, building up a room at a time and hoping not to be eaten. Only 2 crashes in 605 hours where a vault is lost, so a very stable game. When you get by a certain point (unlocking all rooms and having high SPECIAL characteristics for your dwellers) all you will be doing is a High School game organising 50 or so unneeded dwellers between training rooms to increase their SPECIALs. Quests will become routine once you get a couple of high stat people on them, so become simple moving from room to room in far away vaults.But still the game is fresh as I just start again with a new history. I was born 1960 so some of my imaginary shelters may be around that period. Here are some home rules to freshen / complicate your game or just be horrified at:- Scrap all rusty weapons. Yes even that rusty minigun from your first Lunchbox.- No sci-fi. Only use weapons from the 1950's or 1960's.- Girls only get to use pistols. Men may use the big guns. Jim Kirk says so. Super sexism - girls may not train stats over 5. Men do not get kittens as pets.- Segregation - keep different colours in different rooms. Always. Is there a room management problem here? No simply murdering allowed.  (I suppose Apartheid would be 3 colours?)- Go with the theme from your fisrt Lunchboxes - if it's Royal clothing for example, get medieval on thema asses....And so on. I'm sure it's got another 600 hours in it.Chessboard it.

690,9305,9309,PlanetSide 2,"PlanetSide 2 is a tough one to sum up. First off, you need a decent computer to run this because this game will kill you computer if it can't handle it.

If you do that in this game, it will be a bad expeirience as you constantly die. But it is not meant to be played this way. A game like this needs real co-ordination with you squad and your outfit. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THIS GAME. Thats is crutial, because this is a massive game with over 6000 people per server. Every team needs to co-ordinate. The ""Pay to Win"" model is non-existant in this game. You can play without spending a dime and still kill players who throw down 15$ a month for premium membership. As for bugs, yes there are plenty of bugs, but SOE is updating this game every month, they constantly look at what is wrong so far and try to fix it.

695,6863,6867,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewI've played a fair share of Heroes and Generals since the original release on Steam. The tl;dr? In the past? Yes, play this game. Now? No, this game has become a joke. Trust in the current reviews.Story time.The earning of credits has always been hard, so as to sway you into actually purchasing account upgrades. I didn't necesserily fall for it, but I did purchase an American Soldier, but only due to the fact that I didn't want to keep playing the same infantryman over, and over.1.) There are three ""factions"". Be wary in choosing one for the purposes of joining a War. As long as that war is happening, you will be locked into that faction until it ends. So, if you bought crap, you're going to keep playing that faction. In turn this makes games completely lopsided, as the original faction purchases greatly outnumber the Russians, by far.2.) Matchmaking hell. The matchmaking has always sucked. It's slow and a lot better to just search for your own game instead of wait. Rarely will you find a brand new game to enter, and what you are provided will most likely be because people ragequit and now there is an open spot on a losing team.3.) Almost all of the beginning weapons are garbage. Don't pay to upgrade them or maintain them as it is a waste of coin and credits.4.) About 75% of the time, the person that killed you did so w/ a sniper rifle.5.) Yes, I get it, the weapons give some form of realistic accuracy, but there is def. something off w/ the targeting in game. Since the recent updates, you can stand next to an enemy and empty a clip in their direction, but when you die and see them at full health after a firefight, something is wrong. I'm not talkiing about long range encounters, but the ones where you're waiting for them around a corner, light them up, and die. It makes you question what's going on.6.) Vision. Yes, what others have said regarding the iron sights is true, they block your view a little TOO much... Balance my♥♥♥♥♥7.) There is one part of the game that many do not even use... The ""Generals"" tab where you can semi-direct the war efforts.

709,15392,15397,Business Tour - Board Game with Online Multiplayer,"This game is ok, but the pay to win by cheat rerolling makes this game complete garbage. I am convinced that even in offline play that the system is not RNG, but rather forces you to land on expensive income spots so that you will pay gold to reroll. I also think this game would be much better if the starting money was higher, possibly in the realm of 5 or 10 million dollars. The fact that you have to go around the board multiple times in order to have the equity to start acquiring properties and building them up is obnoxious. For example, Tokyo is almost always ignored completely. This game suffers from the same kinds of downfalls that monopoly does as well. For example, since a majority of the time is spent on the top corner of the board, and since dice roll 7's more on average (if it is based on true RNG), those who acquire cities like Hamborg, London, Chicago, New York, and Las Vegas first will always have an economic advantage. Since these cities are also weighted so much for income, it makes it a terrible rush to get these properties first. Also, the fact I can't sell my cities off to upgrade other cities when I land on them because I don't have the equity makes the strategy in this game dull. All in all, I do like the concepts in this game and the different win conditions, but the horrible implementation of it and the pay to win aspect make this game complete garbage. It's not even worth downloading. Go play monopoly, you'll be much happier. This is just another game that will try to suck your wallet dry by nickle and diming you with microtransactions to win.",0, game ok pay win cheat rerolling makes game complete garbage convinced offline play system rng forces land expensive income spots pay gold reroll think game better starting money higher possibly realm million dollars fact board multiple times order equity start acquiring properties building obnoxious example tokyo ignored completely game suffers kinds downfalls monopoly example majority time spent corner board dice roll average based true rng acquire cities like hamborg london chicago new york las vegas economic advantage cities weighted income makes terrible rush properties fact sell cities upgrade cities land equity makes strategy game dull like concepts game different win conditions horrible implementation pay win aspect game complete garbage worth downloading play monopoly happier game try suck wallet dry nickle diming microtransactions win
710,8652,8656,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewIn the battle of the best of the Battle Royale genre of games, Hi-Rez has decided to release what appears to be a better version of their Paladins Battle Royale game. You get to choose between several different classes with all different perks. The perks depending on which class can be either defensive or offensive.Graphics:If you are used to Hi-Rez games, they are true to their same graphcs as previously seen. Like in Paladins, the characters are cartoon-ish but feel great. The transition from foot to horse is the same as from the Paladins battlegrounds gameplay. Comparing the graphics with fortnite... it keeps pace. 8/10Gameplay:As in all battle royale games, Realm Royale plays out until there is one man/woman standing. Done a bit differently, REALM ROYALE has dropped the player count to 90. Overall there game play pace is steady. Between finding crates throughout the realm with different perks and weapons, you have the ability to breakdown items and forge legendary weapons after obtaining a certain number of points. Making it easier to progress through the game. Clucking someone and chasing them down can be some of the most hilarious and frustrating at times but it makes gameplay FUN. 10/10 for not making me build to protect myselfAlpha Build:The game is in Alpha which you will see direct on the icon after you download it. That being taken into consideration, i feel that the game does have a few things that it needs to fix. Some weapons such as the shotguns have already been deemed to be useless. They are very under powered unlike all other games. Other weapons such as Bows, and some sniper rifles seem to hit targets even when they completely miss the target.  Once fixes are put in place to fix weapons I believe that this game can be one of the best.  Overall laggy play has frustrated me at times but the game appears to get better during play.7/10 I am an avid PUBG player, and have looked for something a bit more interesting. Realm Royale makes it very fun and entertaining to play a battle royale game again. Highly recommend this game....

The only thing you get by paying money is cool skins for your gear. It doesn't have have any effect on the actual gameplay. The game is quite complicated, but that is what keeps me coming back for more, as there is a near-infinite amount of combinations of skills and character builds, most of them with significantly different playstyles. While the campaign does get a little old after a while, (on one character, you have to repeat the campaign 3 times on different difficulties), Grinding Gear Games has said that they have more content in the works that will eliminate this, with a new act scheduled for release in early 2015.

732,3188,3191,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewThis game didn't lag even once while I played it (looking at you PUBG). PREMIUM doesnt give you any advantage, just clothing. Character customization is way better than it actually should be (I mean you can't even see your face anyway, but kudos for the nice touch in there). Different ways to move around the map and make you playstyle more...awesome I guess? You can be death from above with glider(watch the shadows peeps) , extra fast moving from one spot to another with snowboard and climbing pack gives you an edge at the beginning of the match and you can literally be the hospital with two legs (carry tonns of medpacks etc).Now for the dislikes. Can't shoot with smgs from snowboard and while climbing (I heard that they will change that), you can hear the steps of every1 from very far away (annoying, cant sneak around, perhaps they should make another class that is slow, without perks like glider etc but with muffled walking), on medium settings some of the graphics glitch if you look at the trees and stuff (sometimes flashes or textures move around, doesn'd bother much, but still). And last... And least annoying thing, all characters are asian (not that I dislike asians, but why limit it with only this option? You can edit your dude or dudette to look half asian, but thats about it).Can't deside about the ""get to tha choppa"" escaping. I hate and like it at the same time, people never cooperate, but there is a chance that in the midst of chaos etc you can just slip through the opponents and win the match by smokebombing everything.In all other aspects, nothing surprising, if you don't count that it's FREE and it works more or less without flaws.

749,4925,4929,SMITE®,"Overall, a good game I'd recommend to anyone looking for anyone who'd like a little more action in their MOBA.As compared to Dota 2 and LoL, Smite's camera and ability style allows it to put players more in the action and therefore has faster paced gameplay while not compromising the strategy and depth of items in a character's builds. Pros:- Excellent character selection; 85+ and counting, all with interesting passive and active abilities- Pretty consistent updates; every other Tuesday, with patch notes usually released every other thursday/friday- Free to play; anything that matters can be unlocked through playing the game- Actually has some pretty beautiful graphics and views, especially since every map is inspired by some sort of mythology- Has more than one map- See P.S.; too long to explain hereCons- Because of the amount of items, absolute newbies can find it difficult to pick up. I did.- Some gods may feel unfair to newer players, especially Anubis or Loki. With practice, however, both are merely nusiances- Community can be pretty annoying, especially in ranked- HiRez will sometimes unnecessarily nerf gods or items to the point where they're unusable, but they usually do a moderately good job of bringing them backEverything considered, it's a fun game that's best enjoyed with a couple of friends to queue alongside you and help one another through discovering and learning the build meta of each role and god. P.S.: The game has daily login rewards that grow with each sequential login. Assuming you login every day for a week, you get something like 1-2 dollars worth of the game's paid currency, ""gems,"" which seems pretty damn nice from my experience with other free to play games.",1, overall good game recommend looking like little action compared dota lol smite camera ability style allows players action faster paced gameplay compromising strategy depth items character builds excellent character selection counting interesting passive active pretty consistent updates tuesday patch notes usually released thursday free play matters unlocked playing actually pretty beautiful graphics views especially map inspired sort long explain items absolute newbies find difficult pick gods feel unfair newer players especially anubis loki practice merely community pretty annoying especially hirez unnecessarily nerf gods items point unusable usually moderately good job bringing backeverything considered fun game best enjoyed couple friends queue alongside help discovering learning build meta role god game daily login rewards grow sequential login assuming login day week like dollars worth game paid currency gems pretty damn nice experience free play games
750,10296,10300,theHunter Classic,"I've played this game for a very long time (before hooking it up to my Steam account). If you're looking for a hunting game, here's a summary and the pros and cons.Summary:The game is a hunting simulator with a lot of variety in terms of animals, maps/environments, and weapons. It has a skill system to let your time invested actually show progress (tracking, shooting, etc), and aims for a good balance of realism and fun, tending strongly toward realism. You WILL have to spend an hour or more to find a high-scoring animal in many cases, but the animal population is far more dense and high-scoring than in real life. It isn't a shooter where animals will run all over and be easy targets, it's a game of patience for reward, and using common sense, skill and experience to track and kill your targets.Pros: - Free to play, with free animal rotation (several animals are always free to hunt, others require licenses unless on weekly free rotation)- Not pay-to-win--while some purchasable items give advantages, they aren't necessary at all (except in unusual cases of the free rotation animals needing a different legal ammunition than you can get with the free basic shotgun + rifle--not sure that can happen)- Realistic, relatively immersive, and very beautiful landscapes- A wide range of environments (American swamp/woodland/meadow, European forest/alpine mountains, Australian outback, Alaskan winter coast, etc) with a large number of huntable species- Fairly realistic overall animal behavior, and some very nice models- Some animals have coat variations, including normal variations, very rare non-typical antlers, and even rarer color mutations (piebald, albino, melanistic, leucistic)- Seasonal and holiday events offering small but fun rewards- Constant competitions that award $em (the in-game currency purchased with real money) for placing 1st-3rd, and trophies- A skill-up system that benefits you by providing more, and more accurate, information on tracks the more you track (species-specific skills), and gives you a steadier aim with weapons as you grow more proficient with each- A second type of currency ($gm) awarded through comprehensive in-game missions that allows you to buy most consumeables: ammunition (the basic weapons have unlimited free ammo), scent sprays, dog treats, etc- A fairly close-knit community, if you like that sort of thing, on the forum--with very fast customer service responses should you need them. As an example, one member posted his process of designing a recurve bow in real life, and the design team put it into the game to honor it.Cons:- Most of the camouflages, weapons, animal callers/lures, stands, blinds and licenses cost real money (via $em purchases), not the mission-awarded money, to purchase--while available in sales bundles, buying a significant amount of items can add up very quickly. You do not NEED to buy these items, but for example hunting elk without an elk caller can be very difficult. You CAN buy scents for $gm instead, but they have 50 uses.- To be able to hunt all animals at all times, rather than relying on the free rotation, you will need to buy a membership (not really a con; they are very very cheap, but it's notable for those unaware). You can buy individual timed licenses for $gm, but they are very comparatively ""expensive."" (It's really worth it to get the 3-month basic membership, it's just a few dollars)- Some animals do have wonky animations, nothing too serious; likewise there's always a few floating rocks and trees in the very large maps, but devs are consistently fixing what is reported- The loading range could be better--animals will ""blink"" out of existence at about 400-450 yards, I forget which, until you get closer again--my biggest gripe- Very little animal interaction--while they move in realistic group types (i.e. bachelor herds, mixed groups or solo) depending on species, no animals currently fight, and the only predator/prey interaction is wolves occasionally chasing elk. It can be a little disconcerting to see a bear standing next to a deer!All in all I think it is by far the best hunting game out there, easy to get lost in its zen space as you wander the very detailed, beautiful landscapes. The game's players include a large number of actual hunters, so I figure it's probably fairly close to the real thing, enough to be entertaining. The psychology of the luck of the draw--whether that deer you're tracking/calling in is going to be a little buck or a monster trophy--can be both addicting and rewarding, and it's easy to put the game down and come back a week or two later and still have plenty of fun.TL;DR, Best hunting game currently on the market (imo), worth the download if you're wanting to try one, good community/dev team and beautiful game to lose yourself in at a relaxing pace with occasional thrills. Best played with around $20 input for a membership (unlimited basic free ammo + licenses) and a caller or two, but playable without.",1, played game long time hooking steam account looking hunting game summary pros cons summary game hunting simulator lot variety terms animals maps environments weapons skill system let time invested actually progress tracking shooting etc aims good balance realism fun tending strongly realism spend hour find high scoring animal cases animal population far dense high scoring real life shooter animals run easy targets game patience reward common sense skill experience track kill targets pros free play free animal rotation animals free hunt require licenses weekly free pay win purchasable items advantages necessary unusual cases free rotation animals needing different legal ammunition free basic shotgun rifle sure realistic relatively immersive beautiful wide range environments american swamp woodland meadow european forest alpine mountains australian outback alaskan winter coast etc large number huntable fairly realistic overall animal behavior nice animals coat variations including normal variations rare non typical antlers rarer color mutations piebald albino melanistic seasonal holiday events offering small fun constant competitions award em game currency purchased real money placing skill system benefits providing accurate information tracks track species specific skills gives steadier aim weapons grow proficient second type currency gm awarded comprehensive game missions allows buy consumeables ammunition basic weapons unlimited free ammo scent sprays dog treats fairly close knit community like sort thing forum fast customer service responses need example member posted process designing recurve bow real life design team game honor camouflages weapons animal callers lures stands blinds licenses cost real money em purchases mission awarded money purchase available sales bundles buying significant items add quickly need buy items example hunting elk elk caller difficult buy scents gm instead able hunt animals times relying free rotation need buy membership con cheap notable unaware buy individual timed licenses gm comparatively expensive worth month basic membership animals wonky animations likewise floating rocks trees large maps devs consistently fixing loading range better animals blink existence yards forget closer biggest little animal interaction realistic group types bachelor herds mixed groups solo depending species animals currently fight predator prey interaction wolves occasionally chasing elk little disconcerting bear standing think far best hunting game easy lost zen space wander detailed beautiful landscapes game players include large number actual hunters figure probably fairly close real thing entertaining psychology luck draw deer tracking calling going little buck monster trophy addicting rewarding easy game come week later plenty fun best hunting game currently market imo worth download wanting try good community dev team beautiful game lose relaxing pace occasional thrills best played input membership unlimited basic free ammo licenses caller playable

Pets give boosts. Weapons improve damage, and clothes improve the abilities of the survivors (Strength, Perception, Charisma, Intelligence, Endurance, Agility and Luck).CONS- Saving does not work properly, when you log off, your base may suffer a rollback, or it could save in inapropriate times like fighting an impossible wave of mole rats that will kill all your survivors. Leaving you to grind money for a long time to be able to bring them back and probably lose all of them again on another attack.- Monsters will keep spawning inside your base (in huge amounts per room) after you get a certain amount of survivors, something that turns to be almost impossible to defend while having survivors outside doing quests or having them pregnant.- After a while the game starts getting boring because its always the same thing, get energy to power the other rooms, get food and water to keep your survivors happy, put the designated survivors in their rooms, and grind for resources, get money and upgrade rooms, do quests that are pretty much all the same.

It's useless, and this is actually the only reason this game made me give it a negative review. More about Gaijin now.This software does nothing in particular except say ""Hey i'm installed :D"" it also creates this taskbar shortcut on the bottom right which you can turn off, but it will almost instantly reactivate itself, it also has no uninstall option.

Now don't get me wrong i fell in love with this game, and had sooooo many fun hours and have met some amazing people who i still talk to even though i don't play much anymore.So why have i given it a negative?10v10 or 7v7 - now only 5v5Map Shrinks - Try avoid that drone now lolMegabots - Simply removedDrones.....DRONES!!!Old Style medic guns had a dmg use and took skill to aim - now auto aim only and no secondary dmg ability.Tech trees of old - Nothing at all now (although they are putting this back in i hear, another old idea they are going back to AFTER the release of the game /facepalm)CPU/weapon energy being important - In the past this system has come and gone multiple times.Tiers (ie. a place for seal clubbing) was a BAD idea when it was first implemented, was thankfully removed - This is coming back soon....really? REALLY GUYS??? new players won't stay long.They jumped right on the loot crate wagon and have since been trying to back out of the whole idea with their tail between their legs. SHAME! (again they are reverting back to the old system, sense a pattern yet?)Meta Bots - (ie the top robot for very high MMR matches) isn't it balanced you ask? Not in the slightest, Drones have dominated the top tier for well over 2 years now (they have varied in design but the fundamentals have always stayed the same) They are too quick at turning, they can take more damage than something that size should be able too, a team of 5 drones all with backup medic guns (remember these just auto aim) will make any well organised group quit if they aren't willing to buy this said ""meta"" bot of the crf.My final point is about the Community Robot Factory (CRF) -  This simply killed the game off. No longer do you need to understand the mechanics of the game, simply type ""drone"" or ""meta"" into search engine and hey-presto you have a top tier robot. The game seemed split after the release of the CRF of people who could build and those who couldn't.

779,12558,12562,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"Having spent some time around the various racing sims, I can say this is not the most realistic, not the best looking and not the best feeling (Force Feedback) sim out there. But currently it's my favourite,The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down. Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.

794,5148,5152,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewThis game is smash bros., but it's not... First of it's many differences from smash bros, is that your ""Legend"" only starts with unarmed attacks. These are weak but can be very fast attacks. ( good for rabbit punches, almost litterally )Then you see a generic icon that looks like a flaming sword stuck in the ground. This is a random weapon pick-up spot. If  you grab this you will get one of your Legend's weapons, which include, spears, guns, dual daggers, hammers, rocket lances, and swords. These do more damage than your  unarmed attacks.  Some attack faster and more powerful than others. Now here is the equivalent of a ""Special"". Every character has 2 special attacks, 1 with each weapon respectively. Some are ranged and some are close range. The graphics are kind of cartoony, and are really fun! (you can tell the devs had fun making this game) There are also bombs, 1 kind that explodes on contact, 1 that is kind of like a sticky bomb that will explode when touched, or after a certain time limit. There is also a horn that summons your mechatronic valkerie, which flies in with a weapon, and on fire hitting your enemies. The music is fitting for the arenas and not bad.And when you win ( or lose ) There is a chat box, in which you can say ""GG"" or ""HACKER!!!"" or ""LAAAAAG"", pretty much whatever you want... people just log out anyhow... :[ It's still a good feature!All in all I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE <3 <3 <3 <3 THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just apply for the beta, just DO IT!

795,1035,1038,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewLet me start off by saying that this game needs a LOT of polish.  Let me also say that it is currently day two of alpha early access, and we've already seen SUBSTANTIAL polish with a patch.  I first heard about Fractured Space by watching a video on Youtube from The Mighty Jingles.  If you haven't already seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.  The dev team behind this game is a hard working machine.  I've been a part of several different alpha tests/early accesses, and I've never seen a dev team put together a patch on day two.  To drive my point home, the newest expansion for Warcraft just dropped, and they're STILL having problems, and Blizzard has an almost infinite number of resources throw at its problems.All of that being said, if you're a fan of DOTA-types or World of Tanks/War Thunder, then this game will be a definite download.However...There are still currently a lot of bugs.  A LOT OF THEM.  I have been playing off-and-on since official early access release last night, and I've only been able to fully complete one match.  This is the nature of the beast when signing on not only to any early access game, but especially one that is this young.  I knew it was going to be like this going in, so please don't take this as a complaint.  The game is MAGNIFICENT.  The gameplay is fantastic, and tactics and patience are well rewarded.  So, should you buy into the early access?  Only if you want to support the dev team as they continue development.  If you are easily frustrated by constant game crashes and unbalanced powersets, then please wait until the game has been developed further.  Also, if you just want to pay to be able to play the game early, you should probably rethink your decision.

I love playing it, I love getting better at it and I love playing it with friends.It is in early access sp currently it isn't perfect, at the time of posting there are some server issues but it is their top priority to fix them and as of late it all seems good now. The devs free2play model is one I agree with, everything you can buy has no effect on your ingame abilities or strength. You can buy purely cosmetic skins, XP and credit boosts (XP and credits are used to unlock ships and loadout options) and premium ships. Since ships are designed for diffident roles, if you buy a ship you will not have an advantage over another player. No one ship is better than the other, they're better at their given role. Also all premium ships can be unlocked in game just like any other ship.If you like space ships, blowing up space ships and laughing manically when you sneak in to cap an enemy's base, this is the game for you.

820,7471,7475,Trove,"This is an edited review so bear that in mind. Trove was a fun game for me, before the Mantle of Power update, I enjoyed it heavily because of the new stuff that it offered and the goal of getting radiant gear. It offered a gallery of item cosmetics designed by others that I enjoyed experimenting with to make each of the 12 or so classes I had unique. Doing the shadow towers was also a fun experience for a time. Clubs were also a large part of why I stayed as it allowed to meet other players to converse and help one another as well as to build in a sandbox world unique to that club. Crafting mounts and pets was very fun as well - I loved the variety.However, these things only last a certain while. Over time I realised that this game was nothing but grinding. You would complete a dungeon out in the world in less than a minute to move on to the next one, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat 200 times a day. I didn't mind the grinding part because it was removed in a sense by the time the marketplace came out where I could earn my fortune by buying and selling items on the market place for money to buy better gear and I could live with that. Then, Mantle of Power. It's what turned this game into a grind fest. There's no avoiding it other than spending a large amount of money on gem boxes to increase your odds of ranking up gems. Gems, by the way, can only be earned from boxes that you get from a dungeon. They offer three varients of; common reward, lucky and rare. These correspond to the item rarities in game that gradually increases the higher level world you go to. This means that you'll spend hours grinding gems, upgrading them to only get an entire new set by the next world. It's ridiculously grindy. By the last level, it will take 70 boxes to get one rare gem- that can have awful stats- that you probably won't use. That's 70 dungeons, or 35 with premium. Oh. Did I mention that you'll have to do this for basically every class?Without these gems, you can't progress in the shadow towers (that are like raids) as you need the highest level of gems to basically compete after normal difficulty. After you get the best gems possible the final boss in the entire game can die in a few seconds with other people at a similar level. Some classes are basically useless in this level of difficulty anyway. Then, there are dragons. Dragons can be earned by completing challenges of doing dungeons in a specific biome every hour. You get boxes that allow a chance to get dragon souls and dragon coins. Now, considering you need 100 dragon souls for basically the full dragon collection, that's a lot of challenges. This would be okay if it was only a few dragons, but there are around 10 that do this. This gives mastery (a measure of your collection) that gives bonuses on its level. The dragons also give a buff that allows for magic find that is required to get even a chance of finding high level gear normally. Then, other dragons require 300 dragon coins which is a lot for one dragon, especially since there are so many of them now that all give the magic find buff. Other dragons need a dragon egg, or a few, as well as dragon coins. And 3 other dragons give a bigger buff and require a stupid amount of luck just to get the egg! It's too much for just that.The premium function allows extra experience, less boxes needed for a guranteed rare and extra magic find, along with other benefits. The extra experience is handy since it will take literal weeks of constant grinding just to get to the max level of 30 in the highest difficulty. Less boxes needed for a rare basically sets you back by miles if you don't have premium as it'll take you twice as long just to get anything of value. The extra magic find is also needed; unless you don't have all of the dragons which is highly unlikely; to get a chance of finding higher level gear. Speaking of higher level gear, it's so easy to come by now, they may as well give it to you. The materials have dropped in price and can easily be gotten if you can handle the market place well. I played this game a lot and enjoyed it for a while. The mixture of Minecraft and an MMORPG was incredibly enticing for me and the grind was more manageable back then. Now, there's no avoiding it. Either hours and hours put into it, or you get nothing. It's a shame. So no. There are too many things wrong to put into this modest review. Enjoy a few hours of the game if you want, but just be prepared for what's after.",0, edited review bear mind trove fun game mantle power update enjoyed heavily new stuff offered goal getting radiant gear offered gallery item cosmetics designed enjoyed experimenting classes unique shadow towers fun experience time clubs large stayed allowed meet players converse help build sandbox world unique club crafting mounts pets fun loved variety things certain time realised game grinding complete dungeon world minute forth rinse repeat times day mind grinding removed sense time marketplace came earn fortune buying selling items market place money buy better gear live mantle power turned game grind fest avoiding spending large money gem boxes increase odds ranking gems gems way earned boxes dungeon offer varients common reward lucky rare correspond item rarities game gradually increases higher level world means spend hours grinding gems upgrading entire new set world ridiculously grindy level boxes rare awful probably wo use dungeons premium oh mention basically gems progress shadow towers like raids need highest level gems basically compete normal difficulty best gems possible final boss entire game die seconds people similar level classes basically useless level difficulty dragons dragons earned completing challenges dungeons specific biome hour boxes allow chance dragon souls dragon coins considering need dragon souls basically dragon collection lot challenges okay dragons gives mastery measure collection gives bonuses level dragons buff allows magic find required chance finding high level gear normally dragons require dragon coins lot dragon especially magic find buff dragons need dragon egg dragon coins dragons bigger buff require stupid luck egg premium function allows extra experience boxes needed guranteed rare extra magic find benefits extra experience handy literal weeks constant grinding max level highest difficulty boxes needed rare basically sets miles premium twice long value extra magic find needed dragons highly unlikely chance finding higher level gear speaking higher level gear easy come materials dropped price easily gotten handle market place played game lot enjoyed mixture minecraft mmorpg incredibly enticing grind manageable avoiding hours hours shame things wrong modest review enjoy hours game want prepared

823,9933,9937,Elsword,"    XD here with a brief review of the game Elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes adventuring socializing, talking and trading items. Also, who don't mind spending a few dollars on customising and upgrading the character or characters they plan on using later on in the game. This game is a side strolling 3D beat em up japanese anime game with real-time fighting doing combo combinations while using spells and magic moves and skills in your repithior to defeat your enermies. You can also use skill points to unlock new skills and new moves as you progess through the game and get stronger meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different ways and set different  skill moves to manipulate his/her character the way they see fit. Each character has his/her storyline of why they are here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you won't put down when get heads and tails of things :). I just a few months ago tried the game myself and today still play it because there are so many things in the game that you can do and new things and great deals and oppertunities get added to the game on a regular basis. Plus you can hang out in this game with your friends form parties and/or groups together talk, trade, socialize in real-time go in dungeons together or solo talk and stratigize while fighting with your friends in real-time. Or if you got to go or stop playing for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group/party at anytime with the push of a button on your character's personal social option. Plus they start you off with ten resurrection stones and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game. At the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character's storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game. If it turns out that you don't like that character you could make up to four characters or four of the same characters in anyway you see fit. From the clothes they wear to the way they fight, you controll it all. Or you could chose the character you don't want any more and press delete the game would then ask you: ""Are you sure you want to delete the character?"" Click yes and the character will be deleted no and the character will be spared. In my opinion, this game is one of the best  games i have ever played and am in it for the long-hall/run they people in this game will get tired of seeing me and say ""oh there gos XD again.""

829,3059,3062,War Thunder,"Product received for free        After playing this game for two years I sadly must give it a poor review. Although, let's keep it in perspective it is a ""free"" game with options to ""pay"" for upgrades. So is it really free then?         I have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes...blah blah blah....try the ones you like don't drive the ones you don't like, move on.  So my complaints aren't about the game when it works.         The key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows:         1) War Thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer, and continues to date, which drives my maleware detector crazy. Why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me. My question is this, why would Steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site.         2) War Thunder sends out daily downloads. Is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates? Really! I understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day! Come on.         3) The straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the War Thunder server. I checked my own settings to ensure it wasn't on my side and it wasn't. But after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects, it has finally driven me away from War Thunder.         The moral of the story is this. You get what you pay for. If ""free"" game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isn't really free. Oh and by the way, yes I did ""pay"" for ""golden eagles"" to improve my upgrade performance.

They both have health bars that go up, and the objective is to knock the enemy off the map. Where the two games really differ, however, is in Brawhalla's use of weapons. Each character has two weapons they can collect in game, thus giving them 3 different move sets (One for bare hands, and one for each weapon). This system also makes it much easier to learn how to play, as besides a few variations, each weapon has a very similar moveset, allowing you to learn how to play the weapons, and then molding your use of each weapon to fit a character's playstyle. Overall, Brawlhalla is an amazing casual or hardcore fighitng game that is very easy to learn and a fun challenge to master.",1, early access reviewgoing game expected pretty basic super smash brothers clone surface games extremely similar health bars objective knock enemy map games differ brawhalla use weapons character weapons collect game giving different sets bare hands weapon system makes easier learn play variations weapon similar moveset allowing learn play weapons molding use weapon fit character playstyle overall brawlhalla amazing casual hardcore fighitng game easy learn fun challenge master

One of the main reasons I play it is because it is one ongoing battle without having to wait for matches to start etc. When the servers are busy, it feels fantastic; the battles are huge and it is one of the most intense feeligns you unlike any other you have come across in gaming.The F2P system is very fair.

871,9945,9949,Elsword,"This my review... my lord... i've played this joint since like... 2011-2012 (or which ever year that nasod ♥♥♥♥♥ eve came through)... round that time or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. and I liked the gameplay, and the battle system. I've been on and off with this joint, since bearly any of my friends play Elsword. (i dont play the steam version that often so dont judge me based on that alone)Now around the two years i mentioned, It wasnt that bad... though the dungeons took like 500 years to complete and it took way too damn long to level up back then too but I digress. PVP was ok, and the community wasnt as toxic as it is now.im not sure when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t started happening, i'm assuming either around the previous skill tree revamp and Ara's release, or when the homie Add was released... but this community got way more toxic with age. PVP is pay to win af, ♥♥♥♥♥s out here with P2W armor and +10 +11 and possibly even +12 gears up in this ♥♥♥♥♥... while im sittin here with my free items n all that. We got laggers (♥♥♥♥♥s who can't fix they damn internet), Trolls (source of toxicity,scum of the earth), Bearers of the ring of fury (♥♥♥♥♥s who fish for free catches at the beginning of the match), Overly Geared people (♥♥♥♥♥s who are geared to where they look like they ready for world war 3 or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ , and Salty type ♥♥♥♥♥s (people who say you're a spammer when you beat them...even though combos in elsword are litterally the same♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways.)For those of you new players who came for balance... lemme give you some friendly advice... you sure as hell aint gonna find it here... even if you're skilled, if your opponent has kaioken x10 gear equipted and their stats are too damn high (primarily crit and attack speed where you hit like goku, but you hit faster then star platinum on some ORAORAORA type♥♥♥♥♥♥) and you have normie gear then you're screwed unless the guy you're fighting with said gear has an IQ below 40, and tbh, thats rare fam.I really hope they fix the pairing system too... I make a new character, get him to level 20 and im like ""hey, lets do some PVP... 1st match, got stuck with a wimpy npc right? I kick his♥♥♥♥♥and move on. 2nd match... get stuck with a beefed up lvl 70-80 (cant remember the level cuz i died so dam fast) Reckless fist with his beefy♥♥♥♥♥1-hit ko type♥♥♥♥♥gear and his hyperactive on the ready to kill my♥♥♥♥♥out of sport...of all the people i could've been stuck with.This game in terms of dungeons... well... they certainly nurfed and changed some dungeons in the game thats for sure, because ages ago... all the stages used to take ages to complete...jesus christ... nasod core back then had like...20+ segments, and to get the super sonic title you had to beat that joint in 8 minutes. but now that they nurfed the length of the dungeons, its alot less cringeworthy to play them now... so thats something that KOG did right.however even with all that i've mentioned in terms of dungeons... it still takes WAY too damn long to level up... after you get out of 30's... good luck leveling because you're gonna have a hell of a time.Even with all this said however, I really like the designs of the characters, their unique move-sets and techniques, those alone are what keep reeling me back in.  But i cant deal with how overpriced everything is in this game... i mean... LOOK AT THE STEAM DLC ALONE!....Each dlc pack is like... $40 a piece... all them ♥♥♥♥♥ put to gether come up to about $180and the dlc packs dont even got much in em either.If you're a new player... I would suggest going to Void Elsword... Way more fun, Doesnt take a centry to level up (got my infinity sword to level 80 within a day in fact).Void community is less toxic and is actually more helpful, and the game is alot more generous when it comes to stuff that costs money... matter of fact, they give you nice stuff for free, they give you perm sets, perm +10 gear, all that good stuff, and all you have to do is play the game.

888,12129,12133,Bless Online,Early Access ReviewOk here is my review about this game. The game itself is nice graphics and fun for combat and neat for taming pets and lots of other cool things. But hhis game is going to fail big Time and there are only 2 reasons for this. Reason number 1:  You cannot send mail to your friends.Reason number 2: You cannot trade items to your friends.These 2 things are the most important functions to have working in a MMORPG.Why would a game company make a MMORPG and include a mail system that only allows you to send mail to alternate characters and when you right click on a friend who is in your party there is a trade with player option but when attempting to use it you get error message and it turns out the company who made bless online is not allowing people to trade with their friends. The trade is option is 100% disabled on purpose by the game company. They say its to stop gold sellers. LMAOThis game has a massive crafting system and like any MMORPG there is always alot of people who love to trade stuff to their friends and family who play the game in order to help them level their crafting and or give them in game money to help them buy stuff as well as to avoid auction house fees if you can just sell directly to another player instead. As well as craft tons of gear to give to their friends and family for free.They say they did this to stop gold sellers.  This does not stop gold sellers at all as they can just ask the person who wants to buy gold to put up a crap item on the auction house for a huge amount of gold which the gold seller will buy and this allows the person buying gold to get their gold. This also prevents crafters from crafting items to give to their friends or family unless they can somehow manage to buy it on the ah for a low price before someone else gets it when trying to help out friends and family with crafting mat and or gear.  I find this is a game breaker for me me and 4 friends just got this game a few days ago and we all found out today we cannot trade or mail each other so we all just quit the game right now.  They should just make this game single player game since you cannot trade or mail your friends LMAO.

897,1027,1030,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI really liked the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ships so overall a fantastic space shooter that i've been looking for, however two things i found lacking on a first impression and limited play. First off in general i felt it  was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. And second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. Frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. Where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability. Of course i only played about an hour, so i may be missing some of what the game has to offer, this is just first impressions.",1, early access reviewi liked atmosphere ability control large capital ships overall fantastic space shooter looking things found lacking impression limited play general felt fast combat speed destruction larger capital ships second larger capital ship undergunned large ship frigates corvettes destroyer style ships quick manueverable limited options weapons sacrificing heavy weapons armor manueverability speed larger cruiser battleship carrier options harder kill assortment heavy weaponry severe cost speed manueverability course played hour missing game offer impressions

903,5158,5162,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewJust recently invited to play the beta, i'm barely at even 2 hours playing time!I have to admit i'm a huge fan already!Maybe because i like super smash on nintendo so much. It really is quite simular, but has it's own nice differences to stand out.I like the way you are able to unlock so many things. collors, skins, weapons and even the possiblety to level up characters.The way to do this could be a little bit more faster. Now you can earn gold with missions and I feel it's a bit slow. Never the less. It is a beta so things can change!For example, I hope to see characters unlocking by a story or tournement. Besides the normal way there is now. Also the money i earn with missions is ok, but i can only do a set number each day, wich makes it slow. Last thing, i feel the shields need some more work. The difference with smash is nice, but the dodging could be better. (could also mean you need to train more in it.)The best thing I like is the unlocking and defenitly the weapons. every character can use two different ones from the start. I believe they can use more later. what is nice with it, are the light and heavy attacks. every light attack is the same with every character, but the heavy's differ. this goes for every weapon a character can use! This way there is something femiliar and something different to try out with every character and they're starting weapons. Besides this, the non weapon fighting does not change.

907,5088,5092,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewOkay, I have been proven wrong before when I have enjoyed a game in Beta, but I really hope this goes through into actual full release.When people say it is like Smash they are right. When thy say it is a Smash clone, they couldn't be any more wrong.The basic set up is very Smash-esque but the play is a style in its own right. You play on a 2D stage with minor elements of hazzard such as pit falls and smashing an opponent off the stage which is all very Smash like.But where it comes into its own is its style of combat. You all start off bar fistedwhich all have the same move set of a straight knuckle, upper and sweep to knock an opponent off.But each character has two sets of weapons which you obtain randomly from pick ups in on the stage, a good few seem they are cloned but most have their own unique combat style and flare, making no two the exact same to play as. You also play with low gravity and a lot of moves capable of keeping you air born, making for some cool air born fights and juggles. Even when it seems to be over when you are falling to your death, you can make an epic come back when you use the right moves from the edge of the stage.The combat style is what I love the most though about the game. It is all fast, all go with no time to rest, yet it flows really nice and keeps you excited, even if you are losing you are still just enjoying the rush and pace.To top off, each character has their own bio and are quite unique in the looks department and varied. There is quite a selection already and can't wait to see what other characters they release and what new weapons they include.All in all if you like Smash, Get it! If you like a decent and developing fighting experience with quirky characters, Get it! If you just want a game to let off steam on or just enjoy PvP, Get it!",1, early access reviewokay proven wrong enjoyed game beta hope goes actual release people like smash right thy smash clone wrong basic set smash esque play style right play stage minor elements hazzard pit falls smashing opponent stage smash like comes style combat start bar fistedwhich set straight knuckle upper sweep knock opponent character sets weapons obtain randomly pick ups stage good cloned unique combat style flare making exact play play low gravity lot moves capable keeping air born making cool air born fights juggles falling death epic come use right moves edge stage combat style love game fast time rest flows nice keeps excited losing enjoying rush pace character bio unique looks department varied selection wait characters release new weapons include like smash like decent developing fighting experience quirky characters want game let steam enjoy pvp

909,3287,3290,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewFirst off this game is far better than PUBG and FORTNITE. In my personal opinion I find it takes everything wrong that is with PUBG and just fixed it. And I find its better than Fortnite cause honestly Fortnite is just a prime example of a company selling out (Refering to EPIC killing Paragon for Fortnite and then releasing 12mil$ of assets for free on Unreal just to say ""hey we're done with this, we care more about money than our work, so y'all can finish the game) but this review isnt about those two games its about this one. First impressions was superb, I really enjoy the character customization menu and the variety of clothing options you can preview beforehand. Now when I played on the beta, it wasnt a snow map, so this makes me think they will be adding seasonal maps with a variety of packs to go with them. Now the big thing of this game is the pack system which I will give a pro and con of.GliderPros: Best mobility pack ingame in terms of moving speed, you can literally glide across the map, the glock is niceCons: I find you need to start in the mountains for this pack to shine as its limited to where you can use it. Lowest capacity start off (so need to focus on finding a backpack for max carry)SnowboardPros: Can be used almost anywhere uphill and downhill, can cover great downhill distance, medium mobility and medium capacity, can do gnarly jumpsCons: You're limited to certain paths, (it kind of contricts the pro I've mentioned but its a little harder to explain, you would have to see for yourself)Rock Climbing Kit (My personal fav)Pros: Can use ice axes to quickly skim up and down slopes, max starting capacity, the shotgun is decent, zipline is motor driven so can be used up and down, can jump off early at your own risk if you see incoming threats, can cover long distances fastCons: I find the rock climbing itself is very linear and there arent as many rock paths as ziplines, zip posts can be easily camped.Now thats out of the way I want to give more insight on the game, it has hit markers, it has bullet drop, I find the guns are balanced except for the fact that hip firing is so useless I wouldnt recommend it. The way you all spawn in the map is different than the traditional ""bus/plane"" the map is divided by what i can roughly estimate a 30x30 grid (Its a guestimate I havent actually counted) and players can choose which square they want to go, it lights up to signify its taken, so can choose to fight right off the bat or dont. The loot is not scarce at all, you will always find something somewhere, the 3 guns you can have I find is a little overkill but Im not complaining. All and all for an early access game and for me to pump out this much information in the 3 odd hours I played is just very entertaining. This is my first review of any game. Please feel free to share your thoughts, why you agree or disagree with the points i've made. P.S to the devs: Please look into the idea of making Rock climbing kits a permanent thing, it is so useful and I find it should be essential, but so far love the game, can't wait to see whats in store and potential console port.

914,8546,8550,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewI enjoyed this game from the beginning. FInally there was a FTP battle royal game with a class system which didn't involve unnessary complexity (like building in fortnite). However it was always frustrating from the beginning because of how high the player community skill level is. I mean here is an early access game, yet I never once encountered a new player (noob), but rather seemingly all seasoned veterans, who are clearly experts w/ PC shooters. This made the gameplay very frustrating and difficult to intially get into when you barely stand a chance against any of these people. But with this last patch, I would have to dissagree with the people who complain about it and actually argue that it now balances the game MORE. GIving new players and perhaps people who are NOT experts at PC shooters to actually stand a chance. Although, I do think that forging a legendary class weapon at a forge should STILL be an option, as well as obtaining legendaries from chests being a possibility. If the developers make that simple change, everything else is in place to where it needs to be for this game to be the best battle royale game on the market.",1, early access reviewi enjoyed game beginning finally ftp battle royal game class system involve unnessary complexity like building fortnite frustrating beginning high player community skill level mean early access game encountered new player noob seemingly seasoned veterans clearly experts pc shooters gameplay frustrating difficult intially barely stand chance people patch dissagree people complain actually argue balances game giving new players people experts pc shooters actually stand chance think forging legendary class weapon forge option obtaining legendaries chests possibility developers simple change place needs game best battle royale game market

918,15011,15016,Robocraft,"change this game has made since 2015 has really cut into me one way or another. Robocraft was once a pinnacle of what free-to-play games should be. Viable and exciting progression, entertaining and easy mechanics, and a wealth of fun for all players. The tiering system was expansive, the items easy to unlock, and every aspect was simple. Every aspect was comprehensive. Nearly all of my (at the time of writing) ~310 hours of playing were sank during those so called ""glory days."" My friends and I earned every aspect of our play, and was proud of my stance. I EARNED tier 10. I EARNED Mega. I EARNED every single item in my inventory through dedicated play. Suddenly, it was the rebalancing. Items began rampantly having stats changed, tried and true strats became useless, and cheese strats ran amok. This crucial point in time denoted the point where the devs lost contact with the game. After this, it was a near tectonic shift in the direction of the game. The devs turned a once-loved game into a cash cow, and began squeezing the life out of players little by little with destructive patches and planar-shifts in game direction every few MONTHS. It eventually lead to the way obtaining items had been since forever being changed to some lunacy of a system that I, honestly, spent no time learning because I had already gotten most of the parts I wanted. The real kicker was what happened to the currency system here. They ported your basic currency, and then gave you a sickening fraction of your premium currency transformed into the basic currency, forcing them together. For the thousand-some premium I had, I got a mere 10k. And, yes, 10k seems like a lot, until you find out that a SINGLE ""T10"" (tiers had been removed not long earlier) cost anywhere in the ballpark of 100-300k if my memory serves me right. Previously, one of those would cost oh, say, 600 premium currency? It's been a few years since! You were also rewarded NOTHING for Tech Points, the progression system, and any support ticket for this injustice was responded with a ""eat crap and die"" kind of reaction.Robocraft had its cornerstones butchered, and even today remains a sad husk of what it used to be. I look back frequently to what this game used to be, and feel severely bereft of the love and experience I had, running home after highschool to boot up one of my favorite games with my friends, only to be thrown in the trash with all of the other traditionalists. Compared to when I started in 2014, this game is a sad excuse, and it pains me. I feel no connection to the current state of the game, I feel no love, but what I do feel is a deep wound of offense, especially seeing how its taken almost four years for them to even barely restore a piece of the best part of this game.

All enchants (r10/p), orange artys and weapons, and armor endgame, all boons, pink companions, main companion (Stone of Allure) slotted with r10, and spec’d for pvp..  Yes I had typed Days, of real, total, in-game, gameplay hours (tpye: ""/played"" in-game).. **Fun fact** NW wasn’t originally apart of steam when it was released. It wasn’t until sometime around The Shadowmantle expansion that this game was added into steams store. Which was well after the games release/beta, and well before coming to Xbox One.^^^Believe me when I type no veterans gameplay hours will be represented accurately on a steam account. It’s simply not possible at this point to converge the two coherently. And I would be happy to play my classes if I do get any messages.. But,Moving along, exactly why wasn’t the NW Beta/game originally apart of Steam when other games like NWK were in Steams shop prior to their releases you ask??Well Good question, maybe ask the Devs?? But I’m sure they’ll just      make some story up anyways.. Think about it, they are The Wizards of The Coast ;)Which honestly doesn’t mean that what they have here is a failure at making an extremely fun mmo for new players in the DnD world.. Or to existing fans of the DnD community. Because it’s in fact the opposite, and very fun.. But until one beats the game, reaches max level, clears all more difficult-dungeon versions over and beats modules grinds over and over and over…and reaches end game gear...and does it all over for a seperate toon.. Will I also be able to say for a fact, that you would've had to have dug real deep down into that pocket of yours if you’re just an average-Joe gamer.... only wanting 5 hrs of gameplay to beat a game or else you must know a dev. ""Don’t just wait there though at max lvl, you can do much more!! Do it again, all of it?""Get a new class, new arty, lvl an arty, lvl a companion, Wait until Summer, realize how minor differences in refining and grinding, and exploiting, can save you money, or Wait until Winter, Halloween, or put the money to better use in most cases of this games mechanics, event rotations.. or realize why the game blancing still feels broken… imbalanced.. In most areas.. after it all""Do it all over!!!"" because your satisfaction won’t stop untill you have everything (NeverWil). People will try to take from you along the way, websites, players, but mainly it won’t stop because the devs will show no remose for your petty little 40days of gameplay... or petty little 10$. The devs will forever grindout as much money as they can from f2P NW (p2W-NW), simply because they can.. and because NW is no COD, Because one day. NW will die.No one plays it again... the day all devs fear but know lays someday in their games not-to-distant-future. The day No one plays their game (buys currency).Not because it wasnt fun... but for all the reasons above.Ill stop my official review there.. and just comment briefly.. I think anyone reading this game should know the above.. Read this review, and if not play and discuss this with me.. at least with another equally tiered end game.. Read this Before you begin to make very poor financial decisions. Or even talk to someone equally knowledgeable about how to attain most things w/o such terrible financial decisions. NW isn’t worth it.. Look at the real world of games... does any of your real gaming friends care a bout this game??They shouldnt.. and apparently.. ive been able to make it out only before Valandra’s 6th snare feeling not too terribly about it all.. Read this not because of any my many merits in-game.........#Founder(guild rank6).But because its good to know.. Especially when youre new to NW, the warning will be RARE. especially when it comes from someone who has burnt a hole in themselves b/c of this game and learnt much along the way.. RP 101 = Artifact _TYPE to Artifact_TYPE b/c Anyone can do a lot more with the amount of time and money that ive spent on this f2p than me. Which dosent include Free-Warnings.. Even when the expenditures flows right back into the gaming genre.. NW will never burn Bright.dont buy ur bro a computer.. dont buy f2P devs a computer...The candle of f2p's (NW) dies out for a reason.. and it was honestly as clear as a crystal the whole time. its in front of you.. you must be the one to see it... if you cant see it,  then this review wont even mean anything anyways.. and you were doomed from the start. You would only share the same end as me. You would see things for what they were when it was too late, and attempt to warn the other horses of the danger. You know you'll fail to come accross to the right ones and yet wouldn't change anything if you could go back to the day you found out about NW either.. It was your decision to dry out the games content as far as you did and beacuse the content is still so sandy, and dry you shall never care again.. #FreeWarning??Its also good to know to not buy this games content from steam... there have been major redemption errors previously.

934,16623,16628,Bloons TD Battles,"  This is all my opinon but here we go, ok my opinon on this game is its great just how the idea is. What I think is cool is how you can play against other players  while playing Bloons Tower Defense. I find this game very addictive becuase I really like the Bloons TD games, and when I was getting into bloons tower defense 5 *bam* I slam right into a game where I can play one of my favorite games and go against another player. One of the other things that I find very cool is how you can send balloons to the opponent to try, 1. To defeat you by lowering your lives. Or 2. Gaining econemy to help you get money. Speaking of gaining econemy that is one of the other things I truely fine unique in this game is the way you gain money to buy towers, the way is simple and not hard to do. All you have to do is send balloons to the enemy and you will gain a certain amount depending on the balloon. Ok so now I only have one more thing that is good for me and that thing is that it's free it is pretty suprising that a amazing game like this is free while BTD 5 cost money (On Steam). Although it is a great game I'm sure that it does have some bugs,hackers,and issues but I personly find this game very well-made game and I would certainly recommend.",1, opinon ok opinon game great idea think cool play players playing bloons tower defense find game addictive becuase like bloons td games getting bloons tower defense bam slam right game play favorite games player things find cool send balloons opponent try defeat lowering lives gaining econemy help money speaking gaining econemy things truely fine unique game way gain money buy towers way simple hard send balloons enemy gain certain depending balloon ok thing good thing free pretty suprising amazing game like free btd cost money steam great game sure bugs hackers issues personly find game game certainly recommend

938,10861,10865,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an excellent, F2P-friendly digitial card game with engaging gameplay, deeply flexible deck-building mechanics, and a diversity of game modes (PvE and PvP versions of both draft and constructed play). I can't recommend it enough if your a fan of CCGs, and doubly so if you're looking for a more strategic alternative to games like Hearthstone.My background: I played Hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale metas. I moved onto Duelyst and found I enjoyed the more complex, board-based gameplay, but recent expansions have promoted flashy, swingy games with increasing amounts of RNG. I also tried other popular alternative CCGs such as Shadowverse and Elder Scrolls: Legends. Neither hooked me.Eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes. Feel like grinding? Gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the AI for decent, continuous rewards. Ladder shows greater diversity than games like Hearthstone, owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations. Draft is excellent, featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards. It's an awesome way to build your collection, as you get to keep the cards you draft. This allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection, especially as you're starting out.While the diversity of game modes is what drew me in, the rich gameplay is what has really hooked me. Mechanics such as Echo (when an Echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand), Relic Weapons (hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically), defender-prescribed blocking, and Fast Spells (spells that can be played in response to an opponent's actions including on their turn) make for some deep, strategic, and interactive gameplay that is much more rewarding than the back-and-forth nature of Hearthstone. The card-based power mechanics (reminiscent of Magic's Lands) makes deck building very flexible and multi-faceted. Three-faction decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck. At the same time mono-faction decks are quite valiable, with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported. Deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire.Eternal's meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers (who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than Hearthstone's Team 5), but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned CCGs I've played.The game is intensely F2P friendly. In addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes, each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards (the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises). Packs provide twelve cards: 8 common, 3 uncommon (equivalent to a rare in Hearthstone or Duelyst), and 1 rare (""epic"") or legendary. Gold-level chests award packs, and Draft and Forge (draft versus the AI) also award chests at a run's completion. All this is to say, regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection. I've enjoyed Eternal tremendously for its rich gameplay. It's hard to believe the game is still in Beta. Future features like in-client tournament modes and best out of 3 play will only further round out this already stellar game. If you're a fan of card games, especially deeper ones, I can't recommend Eternal strongly enough.",1, early access revieweternal excellent friendly digitial card game engaging gameplay deeply flexible deck building mechanics diversity game modes pve pvp versions draft constructed play recommend fan ccgs doubly looking strategic alternative games like hearthstone background played hearthstone ferociously months growing tired stale metas moved duelyst found enjoyed complex board based gameplay recent expansions promoted flashy swingy games increasing amounts rng tried popular alternative ccgs shadowverse elder scrolls legends hooked eternal drew diverse set game modes feel like grinding gauntlet lets play constructed decks versus ai decent continuous rewards ladder shows greater diversity games like hearthstone owing large deck sizes allow common archetypes exist variety forms combinations draft excellent featuring ladder end month rewards awesome way build collection cards draft allows wonderfully direct way customize collection especially starting diversity game modes drew rich gameplay hooked mechanics echo echo card drawn automatically creates copy goes hand relic weapons hero weapons live totals modified variety means providing extra attacking removal options long time strategically defender prescribed blocking fast spells spells played response opponent actions including turn deep strategic interactive gameplay rewarding forth nature hearthstone card based power mechanics reminiscent magic lands makes deck building flexible multi faceted faction decks common strike nice balance power having options increased challenge necessary pilot deck time mono faction decks valiable faction decks common presently supported deck construction streamlined multifaceted desire eternal meta regularly flux owing consistent tuning developers willingness tact nerf buff hearthstone team generally friendly slower decks aforementioned ccgs played game intensely friendly addition ability cards draft draft modes win constructed nets chest awards gold cards rarity increases chest rarity rises packs provide cards common uncommon equivalent rare hearthstone duelyst rare epic legendary gold level chests award packs draft forge draft versus ai award chests run completion regularly play rewarded allows amassing extensive collection enjoyed eternal tremendously rich gameplay hard believe game beta future features like client tournament modes best play round stellar game fan card games especially deeper ones recommend eternal strongly

947,15004,15009,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewThis is probably the most dissapointing game I've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. This includes overpowered weapons that 1 shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, I could go on for hours.The largest problem I've encountered is players attaching a really OP weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. This mainly occurs with the new AeroFlak Cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.Secondly the insane cost of items. So you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money. Now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs 400 and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. So, you play another match...but there's someone with an AeroFlak, by the way did I mention that the AeroFlak costs 75,000 to buy?But thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs 125,000 to buy, and I bet that leaves you wondering ""but how do I get that?"" well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending MORE MONEY.Anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.This has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? Well other than costing a TON of money (a single day costs £1) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. All of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?1/10 huge dissapointment",0, early access reviewthis probably dissapointing game played old game different easily different game fun challenging gameplay scrapped idea exact defenition pay play includes overpowered weapons shot new players impossibly large sums money required premiums twice items crates non premiums playing match premium additional money like hours largest problem encountered players attaching op weapon robot lowering cpu new players matches meaning win gain easy loot mainly occurs new aeroflak cannon early games destroys ground targets weapon designed anti aircraft gun secondly insane cost items play match come team win gaining protonium crate gain stuff nt want sell gain maybe money want buy oh wait cheapest gun costs selling items gets tenth buy cases play match aeroflak way mention aeroflak costs s expensive item lock rocket launcher commonly cheat weapon costs buy bet leaves wondering sad answer spending obviously loose rusty case inside find junk basically described game feels like non premiums wait premium costing ton money single day costs good access paints yes s premiums twice items crates custom profile pic ect led game pay play feels developers care anymore change gotten greedy money think good fun huge dissapointment

971,10807,10811,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewFor the first 1,5 months this game used to be incredibly fun. I hit master in ranked and draft after I got the first competetive decks built. The f2p aspect is extremely fair. You conistantly get new cards to improve your library.Some colors have been more dominant than other (Time) because of their incredible wide access to game winning mechanics (carddraw, ramp, undercostesd Legendaries like Sand Storm Titan). But the meta was still fairly diverse and since there weren't as many Sets it is normal for a new card game to not have certain deck types enabled while others will be more reliant. (combo vs midrange for example)So I was expecting the devs to address these issues but they actually managed to do the exact opposite. Time got by far the most playables in the new set. They got improvements in almost all areas. Bigger creatueres, more consistant ramp and the marked allowing for an even more consistant 3 turn threat. It got to the point where the entire meta is basically ONLY TIME decks. Whoever is responsible for the development of the Time faction should get fired. Seriously. What in the world are you guys thinking?It forces people to basically play removal piles and they still can't manage the never ending armada of threats Time plays. There is no thought required to build a ranked deck. Just slap all the Time playables together and hurr durr you will win. No synergy, no concept just get the big OPs as quick on the board as possible. And dw to think about it. The devs did all the thinking for you when they threw all the mechanics on the cards for you. Where other factions have to work to get their synergies working. ( add certain cards to grind through your deck. maybe even a tutor) Time just has it inherent in their cards. Creatures with card draw on power drop, creatures with removal included, creatures with global flyer-lock. Just throw them together and you have this game figured out. I was looking forward to the new expansion but after a week of facing the same exact deck and reviewing the designs I am one hell of a salty customer that is turning away from your product. Too bad I really liked the game up until this point but with as little foresight and understanding of meta balancing that the devs showed with their newest stick I know enough to see where this game is going.

However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. Their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.The primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you.TF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money.  It has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.",1, casual free play person shooter translate wide variety game modes incredibly high skill cap diverse classes variety weapons cater large playstyles stand cut rest balancing unfortunately strong legitimately overpowered weapons classes equal usefulness lack cash shop based game stats default weapons generally versatile reliable game skill caps classes keeping mind casual nature game issue balance minor worked player skill team coordination business model requires single item purchased game store gifted premium upgrade package point cosmetic weapon upgrade found playing game crafted purchased game resources fair game best free play models market primary difficulty find game starting lackluster tutorial un cordinated public games little assistance relatively deep tactics game mechanics classes hard skilled coordinate solo play playing friends research game highly recommended wo highly mod friendly variety community servers running custom game modes bit searching find hangouts mini games training servers custom maps unofficial weapons like official game fairly friendly community especially difficult hundreds hours enjoyment game issues requirements invest money problems ultimately minor offers rich fps experience community support satisfy variety tastes issues recommending game fps fan looking team focused objective based shooter

I like card games that actually make me think, instead of one's that are nothing more than smashy smashy time to bashy.

985,10766,10770,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access Review Enjoyable CCG with some flaws.  Borrows UI, visual design, and quality of life features from Hearthstone while moving the design space forward in satisfying ways.  Card combinations can be very powerful allowing for more interesting deck building options.  Single player options are interesting, but lacking long-term replayability opting instead to drive players to PvP battles. (While this makes sense when considering the genre, there is unmined opportunity that Eternal seems primed to exploit. Upcoming expansions look ready to offer more single player options.) Suffers from resource randomness.The big challenge in Eternal is the very poor system governing resource draw. Resource cards are included and then drawn from your deck (like Magic, Hex, etc.), and there seems to be something wrong with Eternal's deck randomization system. It is common to encounter resource glut, sometimes drawing nothing but resource cards during a single match. While a hand redraw guarantees two resource cards, resource drought is also common. While I understand the wish of the design team to stay true to their Magic roots, the competitive, digital CCG space demands design systems that optimize the player experience. And while Hearthstone's steady resource gain system seems to take some of the life out of the CCG experience, it balances the competitive experience in a critical way. Imagine, for example, if Eternal had a steady resource gain mechanic with a 'random' color draw that could determine the type of the resource drawn. This random draw could still be based on a number of resources included during deck building while helping mitigate the game-breaking randomness of resource draw.While the resource issue is enough to keep me from spending a ton of money on Eternal, I have enjoyed the rest of the game. If you're looking for a game with a strong MtG feel but with a mostly modern design approach to the digital CCG genre, I think Eternal is a good choice.",1, early access review enjoyable ccg flaws borrows ui visual design quality life features hearthstone moving design space forward satisfying ways card combinations powerful allowing interesting deck building options single player options interesting lacking long term replayability opting instead drive players pvp battles makes sense considering genre unmined opportunity eternal primed exploit upcoming expansions look ready offer single player options suffers resource randomness big challenge eternal poor system governing resource draw resource cards included drawn deck like magic hex etc wrong eternal deck randomization system common encounter resource glut drawing resource cards single match hand redraw guarantees resource cards resource drought common understand wish design team stay true magic roots competitive digital ccg space demands design systems optimize player experience hearthstone steady resource gain system life ccg experience balances competitive experience critical way imagine example eternal steady resource gain mechanic random color draw determine type resource drawn random draw based number resources included deck building helping mitigate game breaking randomness resource draw resource issue spending ton money eternal enjoyed rest game looking game strong mtg feel modern design approach digital ccg genre think eternal good choice

988,9429,9433,Realm of the Mad God,"Product received for freeas a beginner in this game i found it EXTREMELY hard, with the removal of ammys and addition to pets it didn't make it any easier, in my opinion the ones that has the hardest time in the game are beginners, sure if you have been putting in hours on hours on the game you deserve to be powerful right? Yea that is true but as a beginner you die from taking 3 shots from a ghost god in god lands, and someone who have been playing for a while, your 8/8 with a max legendary pet, you can be afk in godlands, and the only ""hard ""content for us I would say is the lost halls, where everything can oneshot you no matter what you do, thought i have not tried much of the new lost halls i've heard it's still very hard. Shatters are becoming more and more of a joke. Bring a friend along or two that are pretty experienced in shatters and you can do it in like 10 minutes. When i first stepped foot into the shatters i got jumped by an ice sphere and i died. Which also turned me away from the shatters for a long time, but now it's a joke. Everything else is not even worth doing cos it doesn't give you anything cool. Tombs are a great source for Life pots but the rings are EXTREMELY inferior to shatters rings. OT sure the bow is nice and it's pretty easy for mana but like mana is pretty easy to get without an OT. The ""Epic"" dungeons doesn't really give much, the leaf bow (How much i love it) is basically worthless. The doku has just a SLIGHT higher dps than the normal Top-Tiered katana. The cutlass barely exists. The only thing that are worth doing are the events that either deca puts out, or the realm events (Sphinx, lotll etc.) But the only reason you want to do them is for that minimalistic chance for a white bag. But with all this why do i find the game fun anyways? Well it's not really fun but you often have a reason to play! Died recently? Well you need to fill up that character with another maxed character. Want to get higher than Red Star well go out and try out some other classes than knight and wizard. Most Classes are really fun imo. You'll never know which will be your favourite one if you've only tried 2/14 (soon to be 2/15 hype).

999,13005,13009,Fallout Shelter,"It's... okay.It fits solidly in the catagory of being a waiting game with options to pay to get things done quicker. Nothing is impossible to get without paying for it though. And - if complaints made in the discussion threads are true - paying for things is risky since it's completely possible it'll just take your money and not give you what you paid for. But again there's no reason to pay for it. The game is pretty generous on giving you ample lunchboxes (chests of rare loot) and Nuka Colas (items used to speed up wait times) for free on quests and for accomplishing achievements.The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats are not what they are in other games. When it comes to combat the endurance (HP) and agility (attack rate) stats are the only factors. Combat is pretty much a ""watch the characters do all the work automatically"" thing while you give them a stimpack or radaway when needed. The closest thing you get to any tactical decisions is whether or not you'll use a charged-up critical attack now or save it for later in case it's needed. That's it.As a Fallout franchise fan myself I wanted to dabble with it a little. It pokes at my nostalgia. I see a lot of familier weapons and armors from the games. It feels like someone that didn't actually play much of Fallout made it. They may have peeked at the wiki, looked at some screenshots, talked to the devs, ect but they weren't likely actual fans of the series themselves. There were just too many ""thats not how it works"" moments. Which brings me to...Lore NitpicksVaults, in fallout Shelter, send out radio signals to add to their population. In any other Fallout game vaults are pretty xenophobic. Other vaults seem much more happy to see your dwellers visit than they ought to as well. To put this into the realistic light: In fallout 1 you are sent out of your vault to find a water chip. You save your vault eventually - as well as potentially other places depending how you play. But the overseer abandons you because you've been outside of the vault too long and are deemed an outsider for that alone. Your character is left outside to what the overseer can only assume will be your death. Fallout 3's Overseer was even worse.Deathclaws appear in packs similar to molerats or radroaches. In any other version of this series when you get a whiff of a single deathclaw you're on high alert. In this case however you brawl through 10 of them to get through a room. This game failed so hard on what makes a deathclaw a deathclaw.In some quests feral ghouls talk to the vault dwellers. Feral ghouls; the ones that have rotted out minds and are completely senseless zombies that just scream and growl and attack anything with flesh.The vault door - the big iconic cog-shaped door - responsible for holding off the explosion of a nuclear bomb and protect the residents from outside danger falls apart during raider attacks as though it's made of paper mache. Typically about 3 hits with a sword tears a hole right through it - I don't mean they knock the door down. I mean they rip right through it.ConclusionIt's oddly addictive. It's free even if it's an obvious cash grab. It's okay as a time killer or as a game that you might play on the side while doing something else - like reading or youtube. It's nothing great though. Even the guys that made this game probably don't like it enough to play or update it.",1, okay fits solidly catagory waiting game options pay things quicker impossible paying complaints discussion threads true paying things risky completely possible money paid reason pay game pretty generous giving ample lunchboxes chests rare loot nuka colas items speed wait times free quests accomplishing achievements stats games comes combat endurance hp agility attack rate stats factors combat pretty watch characters work automatically thing stimpack radaway needed closest thing tactical decisions use charged critical attack save later case needed fallout franchise fan wanted dabble little pokes nostalgia lot familier weapons armors games feels like actually play fallout peeked wiki looked screenshots talked devs ect likely actual fans series s works moments brings lore nitpicksvaults fallout shelter send radio signals add population fallout game vaults pretty xenophobic vaults happy dwellers visit ought realistic light fallout sent vault find water chip save vault eventually potentially places depending play overseer abandons outside vault long deemed outsider character left outside overseer assume death fallout overseer worse deathclaws appear packs similar molerats radroaches version series whiff single deathclaw high alert case brawl room game failed hard makes deathclaw deathclaw quests feral ghouls talk vault dwellers feral ghouls ones rotted minds completely senseless zombies scream growl attack flesh vault door big iconic cog shaped door responsible holding explosion nuclear bomb protect residents outside danger falls apart raider attacks paper mache typically hits sword tears hole right mean knock door mean rip right conclusionit oddly addictive free obvious cash grab okay time killer game play like reading youtube great guys game probably like play update

1005,7097,7101,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"Some background: This will be my first time reviewing an electronic card game. I've played MTG (Magic: The Gathering) online and IRL, but only at casual levels. I enjoyed Elder Scrolls' games as well.I'd like to begin my review by saying that this game is easy to understand. Like many games, you can learn it in hours, but take weeks to start really excelling and mastering. With all card games as well, you have to learn what every card does and be prepared to do a lot of learning from mistakes.I recommend this game over MTG games due to its MUCH faster pace, challenge, and rewards. You don't have to enjoy Elder Scrolls first-person games to get into this card game. You'll learn everything as it goes. I also like how there's AT LEAST over 100 strategies with the current card sets available in the game, which adds to the challenge and mixes up the meta substantially.It's free to play, so just give it a shot and see if you'll like it.UPDATE: After 120 hours played, I can fully recommend this game to anybody who has appreciated Hearthstone, MTG, and even Pokemon TCG. The new expansion Heroes of Skyrim just came out and now the meta is changing again. I would say now is a great time to get into the game because when there is new expansions, there is also new players. This game is simple, but addicting.UPDATE 2: I'm now over 400 hours and this is the only card game I bother logging into now. It won't be easy reaching Legend rank with commons and rares if you're just starting, but with some face decks, you probably could. This is a good game and could use more players and streamers.

1010,15603,15608,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewRecommended with caution. It's free, so it's not like you're going to have to worry about wasting money on it, but it's not for everyone.The game looks and kind of feels like a very early MMO. The graphics are disgusting, the UI is pretty terrible, and the entire game is a non-stop grindfest, but it's a grindfest you can open and play around with on your lunch break from your phone, tablet, or laptop, and then put away after a 10-30 minute session.This easy no-commitment ""pick up for half an hour"" playstyle has always been what drew me to AE games, and as a long-time fan of the company I do rather enjoy this game as well, but it's really not for everyone.The business model is also so far pretty fair, but AE has a habit of locking a lot of content behind subscription services. So far no such service exists in AQ3D as far as I can tell, but it's probably going to eventually.It's not anything that'll severely limit your ability to enjoy the game, i.e. all major gameplay mechanics are going to be available to you for free, but you can expect that down the line most of the ""cooler"" cosmetic items and questlines and a small handful of classes and areas are going to require some kind of actual purchase, which I know some people are entirely against.If you can excuse a small company trying to feed themselves from their library of free games, and you're looking for a really casual old-school MMO, this is one that's worth taking a look at.",1, early access reviewrecommended caution free like going worry wasting money game looks kind feels like early mmo graphics disgusting ui pretty terrible entire game non stop grindfest grindfest open play lunch break phone tablet laptop away minute session easy commitment pick half hour playstyle drew ae games long time fan company enjoy game business model far pretty fair ae habit locking lot content subscription services far service exists far tell probably going eventually severely limit ability enjoy game major gameplay mechanics going available free expect line cooler cosmetic items questlines small handful classes areas going require kind actual purchase know people entirely excuse small company trying feed library free games looking casual old school mmo worth taking look
1011,1363,1366,Fractured Space,"The Starship Asss SimulatorThe loading screens, the video at the end of a game and the camera show us the wonderful bums of our beloved ships.This is also a part to take care of, because the enemies will often shoot at it! So watch your butt.More seriously now.It is basically a MOBA but with less tactical elements and less important deaths. The emphasis is put on cooperation, as what serves as exp is shared between the team. Every few minutes, an event is triggered in a special area; to the team capturing the objective is granted a strong bonus for 3 minutes.There are 5 “sectors”: two bases (one to defend, one to capture), two “lanes” with three mines each (which give exp) and two “forward stations” (to capture to be able to jump to the enemy base) and the special area.You control one ship of the usual archetypes (tank, DPS, support, stealth) with 5 abilities (counting the main attack). Every 3 level (up to level 9), you may upgrade your damage, health or support. You jump from a sector to an other, fight the enemies for the control of the mines, forward stations, enemy base and special area.I won’t go into more details now, but there are special features (you take more damage when you prepare to jump, the forward stations, if captured, enable to regen health, the ships have armour, you can create a crew…).A few questions and their answers:Is the game interesting? Yes, fun, a bit tactical too.Is it pay-to-win? I’d say no, but if you pay, you may have an small advantage, but it’s still possible not to pay. Is it too grindy? Yes and no. If you only play against AI and don’t make any missions, buying the ships may take you a long time. But the game is surprisingly generous and gives a lot of premium currency (I bought expensive ships with it, without paying).To conclude, I will only say it is a nice game, a bit repetitive, with a small community and rather active devs. Being free, if you want to try it, well do it ^^",1, starship asss simulatorthe loading screens video end game camera wonderful bums beloved ships care enemies shoot watch butt seriously basically moba tactical elements important deaths emphasis cooperation serves exp shared team minutes event triggered special area team capturing objective granted strong bonus minutes sectors bases defend capture lanes mines exp forward stations capture able jump enemy base special area control ship usual archetypes tank dps support stealth abilities counting main attack level level upgrade damage health support jump sector fight enemies control mines forward stations enemy base special area wo details special features damage prepare jump forward stations captured enable regen health ships armour create crew questions answers game interesting yes fun bit tactical pay win pay small advantage possible pay grindy yes play ai missions buying ships long time game surprisingly generous gives lot premium currency bought expensive ships conclude nice game bit repetitive small community active devs free want try

1029,12293,12297,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewI've watched reviews, I've watched streamers and even when  90% of them said stay away.. I brought the game.. Mistake #1 was not trusting a MAJORITY.

Yea, 2 hours only played but I think I've watched / played enough to know what a horrible game looks like.Bless Online - It's like a child's painting when they're only 4 years old. You praise them even though you know its just scribbles and color. That's what Bless Online is. Far from the graphics and animation that looks nice, there isn't anything else there. So many people will say it's because it's in Early Access, but it's like others have said already. Failed in 2 regions, they had enough time to correct issues.. And without properly giving the game a beta test so MAYBE they could've spotted these issues earlier, they opt for EA. Cash grab? Maybe.. Wouldn't go that far.

1030,10433,10437,theHunter Classic,"Note: theHunter is a NICHE game. It's a wonderful niche game, don't get me wrong. But other than the gameplay itself, I have nothing but issues with it. Compare this game to the big name games out there... CoD, Bioshock, Farcry, Skyrim and so forth... ignore the genre. Production value and sales are what I'm comparing here. In all of these big name games have one thing in common. You buy the game, you can play it. All of it. You unlock gear and items as you play through. You don't have to buy additional junk just to complete missions/progress through the game. Occasionally you will have expansions or add-ons, more DLC that you can buy that will in most cases extend the gameplay, but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind. So, I'll take CoD, one of the best known, most loved, and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry. I think I paid $60 when it first came out. That was it, for the whole game, all equipment, all levels and weapons attainable for that $60. Oh, I forgot to mention that you OWN the game at that point, you don't have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content. Now, theHunter. Free to Play? No, it's not mistitled. It's deceptively titled. The F2P portion conains one rifle, one scope, a bleat call, a camera, a GPS and binoculars. Oh, That's fine and all, but you only get to hunt ONE animal (Mule deer) on ONE reserve. If anything, it's a free demo. If you expect to see the rich content in this game, forget it. This ""demo"" is nothing more than a snapshot. Ok,... so that's what you've gotten for free. Let's spend $60 on this game, like we would any other, and see where it gets us. $45 for one year basic, and another $15 for three more months. That's it. That's what you get. I would love to say that you get more, but you don't. You get 15 months, with no additional gear, no additional weapons. Oh, you DO get the option to hunt on all the reserves. You also gt the licences to hunt all of these animals. But you still CAN'T because you haven't bought the proper weapons, proper ammo, proper equipment.... So you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out $60 for 15 months of play time. What's that? Did I just hear someone squeak the words World of Warcraft? Denied. WoW at least gave you access to all of it's content after you've paid your subscription. And no, I'm not going to complain about the subscription, as WoW is/was an MMO. Gotta maintain those servers. Yeah, I know theHunter has multiplayer. Big deal. Out of the 20 people who enjoy multiplayer, theHunter could loose all 20 of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only. You guys want to make more money? Add the cottontails and a crappy shot gun to the ""Free to Play"" version, and call it a free demo. Sell the game for $30, and monthly membership of $5. Make gear and weapons unlockable. Get rid of the microtransaction garbage. I would buy this game for $30. I would pay a $5 subscription, IF I had access to all of the games content after I made those purchases. That's at LEAST $35 you guys would have made from my first month. $5 and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription. However, due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game, I've spent $15 for the subscription, had my fill becasue I refuse to spend more money on trivial, and temporary purchases, and that's it. You've made $15 from me, and you won't make any more. I don't recommend this game. Sure, download it, shoot a few mule deer, and call it quits. For the price you'll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases, (subscription/consumables)  this game isn't worth the disk space it occupies. Even with WoW, purchased when it was released, and played for the first year at about $180 is still cheaper than this. You want a good hunting game? Play CoD, or FarCry, or Bioshock. You get to hunt people and monsters, you get tons of weapons to choose from, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription, and your purchases are yours to keep!! DON'T SPEND A DIME ON THIS GAME.

1031,14486,14491,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewNow this game used to be a lot of fun! It had a solid economy and pretty much worked as advertized, you build a vehicle and then you battle it out in different match types, you would get rewarded, even more with premium, and with the rewarded currency, you could buy new parts for your vehicle... I am writing ""it used to"" because the developer decided to promote their premium stronger and thus changed the economy model to a random drop system. This at the begining might be fun but soon you notice that you can't just buy the stuff you need to build your robot. You would have to recycle your previous rewards in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robits, with which you could buy your desired items then... This means, the game has developed away from it's initial freedom and appeal of a building game, to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish, into a total gamble. You are now totally dependent on luck with your drops and every time you get a loot crate, you are offered additional random drops as premium player. This basically goes entirely against the initial freedom the game was advertized for. There are more issues right now, unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitches they never really got to fixing them but the general trend regarding this game strongly points towards becoming a moneygrab.There are lots of problems, which were solved absolutely nicely before the ""epic loot"" update for example, since everyone wants the protonium crate now, people are playing also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard, resulting in teams not playing together anymore.Also seal clubbing has become really common, bringing high endgame weapons into lower lever matches, to become the topscorer and thus also getting rewarded with the protonium crate... That is right, there is no difference right now, wether you win a match on your level or low level, does not matter, you get the same totally random generated protonium crate, which has the highest chance to give you some legendary items in theory but these chances are still so slim, it is almost always random crap, as well as in the other boxes. So enjoy the game as long as you do but i can't recommend getting to invested in it's current state.",0, early access reviewnow game lot fun solid economy pretty worked advertized build vehicle battle different match types rewarded premium rewarded currency buy new parts vehicle writing developer decided promote premium stronger changed economy model random drop system begining fun soon notice buy stuff need build robot recycle previous rewards order fraction wealth robits buy desired items means game developed away initial freedom appeal building game farm bit buy build wish total gamble totally dependent luck drops time loot crate offered additional random drops premium player basically goes entirely initial freedom game advertized issues right unbalanced weaponsystem old glitches got fixing general trend game strongly points moneygrab lots problems solved absolutely nicely epic loot update example wants protonium crate people playing team spot leaderboard resulting teams playing anymore seal clubbing common bringing high endgame weapons lower lever matches topscorer getting rewarded protonium crate right difference right wether win match level low level matter totally random generated protonium crate highest chance legendary items theory chances slim random crap boxes enjoy game long recommend getting invested current state
1032,4826,4830,SMITE®,"This was once one of, if not, my favorite games. The base concept of the game is amazing. It is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. The problem lies within the developer, HiRez (or TitanForge whatever they are called now).If I had to give this game a rating on JUST THE BASE GAME AND HOW FUN IT IS, I'd give it a 8.5/10Yes, I still play very frequently. But it's only ever with my friends and never alone. I have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but I don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. I've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. I've simply learned too many things and played so much that I would say that I am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.The matchmaking is just a joke. Honestly. I don't need to say more than that. Matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. Either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed in.There are very frequent patches, one or two a month. A new god is also released everyone 1.5-2ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. The problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for LITEARLLY YEARS. Yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since 2014 and was fixed only recently. 4 YEARS! And even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in 30 seconds or something like that.The skins in this game are amazing to be fair. They look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. There's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get 1 or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire YEAR.Again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. Certain gamemodes like Siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. The game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. Patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.It's also frustrating that this year HiRez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on Mixer instead of Twitch. This is when I realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. Viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on Mixer than there would be on Twitch. Not to mention that the Smite World Championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to Smite through Twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.I think I have put more time into this game than any other game I have ever played. I love this game, but I CANNOT stress how terrible it feels to play it. I enjoy it far less and sometimes I'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. I feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. Some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.Yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. I have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest.

1034,2399,2402,Path of Exile,"Don't let the Steam hours decieve you, I have played over 4k+ hours of this game.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I started playing PoE on the 9th of February, 2012. At that time, the game was in Closed Beta, It was hard to get a key to get in. I've been playing the game on and off ever since.First I'd like to start with some Pros and Cons.+ Unlimited replayability.+ Insanely fun.+ Difficult to master.+ Very good economy system.+ It pays off to play with friends.+ Well made microtransaction-system.- Desync.- Starts off slow if youre a beginner.The game is very big. It consists of 3 acts, featuring 3 difficulties plus an End-game ""Map"" system, with a level cap of 100. It even comes with races and ""recently"" they've included special leagues with special formats and gimmicks that the normal ""Standard"" and ""Hardcore"" versions don't have. The game features one of (if not) the biggest passive-tree in all of video-gaming. It is a very big thing, it's what makes Path of Exile what it is. All of the different combinations of skills and passives you can do is endless, you will never do every single combination. Skills aren't granted through the tree, Skills are given to you using different gems, which are given to you through completing the games story-line and finding them by killing things.The economy system of PoE is very interesting, it consists of ""orbs"" that you will find while killing things, these orbs are the currency. For a list of all the currency click here.[www.pathofexile.com] Using these orbs you can trade for different items with other players aswell as with NPCs inside of the towns or your own Hideout.""Well, how does GGG make money of this game?""GGG makes money by their fantastic Microtransaction model. It is -all- cosmetics with some convinence items (stash expansions, these are a great way of supporting the game if you dislike the cosmetics).The game is hard, it's not easy to play and it's definetly not easy to adapt to the desyncs and such. You WILL â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your first character up. I recommend visiting the PoE Forums at first and finding a build labeled ""cheap"" and then following that for your first character. Playing with friends definetly pays off as it makes the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally makes the leveling phase alot more enjoyable. The game even gives you a +50% Increased Drops per person in your party.Overall, the game is alot of fun with very few flaws, biggest one being the desync, but if you enjoy playing ARPGs, or if you disliked D3, this game is definetly worth trying out. And if you never have played before, don't play on Standard, it's practicly the dumpster of all leagues.

1050,2604,2607,War Thunder,"This game has turned♥♥♥♥♥♥ I actually♥♥♥♥♥♥something out this morning that was less♥♥♥♥♥♥than this game. True story. The game is essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money. ""Free"" research points cannot be used unless you have eagles to convert them into usable research points... and of course eagles cost money. You can happily play through the first tier of planes for each region relatively easily, however as the tiers progress, the goals and upgrades become harder and harder to obtain, especially on free-to-play and thus push you towards getting a premium account or paying for game currency. When I first started playing the game, it certainly didn't have such an obvious push for cash but as the updates have rolled on, it's shown it's money grabbing side.Money aside, the game is relatively good. The arcade mode is most people's favourite, with realism lowered and more emphasis on action. There are however two other online modes: Real Battles and Simulation. The game also offers a single player mode and campaign. The gameplay itself has been simplified and allows for control almost entirely through a mouse. There is a vast array of aircraft for several different regions, all of which can be upgraded and to a limited extent, customised overtime. There are also a multitude of maps, most containing land/sea units which have to be eliminated along with airfields and bases.

I had around 70 hours of play here, before I switched to the developers version and added another few hundreds. Why did I switch installs? This is to be discussed at another place. But if you're into sims, you must try out this game. Both of the free planes are great. The SU-25T is a simplified simulation with keyboard shortcuts in place of clickable switches.

1084,6825,6829,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewTo sum it up: pay to win.You start off playing training missions, and for the most part is is quite fun. The game's mechanics are not on par with other WW2 shooters out there such as DoD: Source or more importantly Red Orchestra 2, but you're willing to look past that because of the overarching goal to 'win the war' and the fact that the game's progression gives you incentives to keep playing. Unfortunately it's when you rank up and step out of training missions into the campaign missions where the game comes undone. Whilst it is refreshing to finally see the game as it was meant to be played, that is with multiple goals and not just the domination gametype in the training missions, you'll often be outnumbered or outnumber the enemy team and crush them. Not only that but you'll start playing against people who have spent inordinate amounts of money on ridiculous weapon mods that will one shot you and they'll also take 3x the amount of damage of a normal person due to some insane perk they unlocked via money. Yes you can grind to attain some of these advantages but it is a long and arduous grind, not something the average person could hope to attain. I'm willing to have some iffy balance in a WW2 game seeing as in real life battles are not always fair, but when you get the drop on a guy who is peddling a bike, you put 6 rounds into him and then he jumps off his bike only to one shot kill you it is incredibly frustrating.Something that I very much get in a RO2 match is the feel of war; bullets whizzing over my head, soldiers writhing in pain, artillery raining down close to me. All these things are just non existent in H&G, half the time you won't even hear the shot that killed you, the audio in general is awful.Pros:Progression is definitely there.You feel like there is an overarching goal to 'win the war'.Cons:Wonky mechanics, not as good as other current WW2 shooters on the market.Pay to win or if you are not fond of that term, pay to advance.Awful balancing.No visceral 'war' feeling.Recommendation: Go buy Red Orchestra 2.

1103,5401,5405,World of Tanks Blitz,"The usual reason to play WoT Blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the Porcelain Throne, on a bus or in a queue. Now I can add 'just for the heck of it (without using BlueStacks)' to my list.After 826 battles, I've unlocked:Chi-Nu, Japanese Tier 5 medium tank,AT-2, British Tier 5 tank destroyer,SU-85, Soviet Tier 5 tank destroyer,KV-1S, Soviet Tier 6 heavy tank,Leopard, German Tier 5 light tank.I was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the KV-1 and decided I must also have it. The Soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the T-46 (tier 3). The KVs are very slow and virtually blind. It's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥from behind by a Leopard within the first 2 minutes. The KV-1S was incredibly weak until I got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean I'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.The British AT-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. In a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. It has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). You're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.The Soviet TD line has been pretty much okay all-around. SU-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.German light tanks require skill. A masterful Leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. It's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. German TDs are quite enjoyable, especially the Hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.Surprisingly the Japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. I chose the light branch (Ha-Go, Ke-Ni, Ke-Ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. The tier 5 Chi-Nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. What made the light Japanese tanks so fun was that I could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. Shooting opponents is the fun part of WoT Blitz and the Jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.I think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. At Tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. Battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. So I think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.Why I generally like WoT Blitz:1) Best time killer app I know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example2) Very short match queues - I don't want to queue while I queue3) Progressing through tiers of tanks feels good4) At least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win5) I get to learn tank names6) A lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original WoT for desktop",1, usual reason play wot blitz speed waiting porcelain throne bus queue add heck bluestacks list battles unlocked chi nu japanese tier medium tank british tier tank destroyer soviet tier tank destroyer soviet tier heavy tank leopard german tier light tank initially impressed bouncing dozens shots armor decided soviet heavy tree boring grind exception tier kvs slow virtually blind lottery manage position hard hitting shots absorbing good damage getâ leopard minutes incredibly weak got best gun costing experience reloads slow single miss mean burden boon team british closest cheating game battle highest tier manage enemies yourâ shooting quickly ruin team game mm frontal armor good tier tier going sacrifice speed slow view range kind depend team scout baddies probably easiest tank steal shrugging thousands points damage destroying enemy team soviet td line pretty okay nice low profile hiding rocks hopefully making enemy aim bit high miss german light tanks require skill masterful leopard punch higher weight easy speed group enemies killed seconds start battle okay tree unlock exhilirating german tds enjoyable especially hetzer small frame angled armor plates bouncing shots spotted surprisingly japanese tech line far fun chose light branch ha ke ni ke ho winning battles respectively productive battle tier chi nu useless starting good fully upgraded light japanese tanks fun reach mountaintop small size stats equal smaller tank better bush viable total camoflague guns high maximum depression angles fast reload times enabled shooting second battle shooting opponents fun wot blitz jap tanks offered lots lots think generally holds true higher level play boring gets tier pretty veteran knows sweet spots map punishes mistake harshly battles kill tanks enemy team sniping cleverly pretty think fair recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead focusing hard generally like wot best time killer app know kills lots getting boring difficult effectively time machine waiting dentist short match queues want queue progressing tiers tanks feels cheats pays learn tank lot original wot desktop

1111,9304,9308,PlanetSide 2,"If you have an inkling of interest in games like the Battlefield series, but wish that the scale was bigger, that the game was entirely persistent, and that you as an individual, as a squad, or even as an entire team had an impact on the game as a whole, then Planetside 2 is for you.As an MMO, Planetside 2 delivers an experience that is as social and long-lasting as some of the bigger names in the MMO market, like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, and Final Fantasy XIV Online. As an FPS, Planetside 2 draws the most well-loved mechanics from heavy-hitting genre-changers like Battlefield, Halo, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This game is absolutely unique when it comes to the gaming landscape, only truly comparable to the original Planetside and the PS3 exclusive MAG, both of which were far smaller and less feature-rich than Planetside 2.Over the past two years, Planetside 2 has seen numerous updates. These range from new weapons, vehicles, and gear to entirely new continents, reworkings of existing continents, and mechanics which change the very foundation of how the game works, such as the lattice update and the larger-scale continental lattice. The game has even been optimized to run much better than it did in the alpha and beta stages of development, through the ""Operation: Make Faster Game"" or OMFG series of patches.Sony Online Entertainment, Planetside 2's developers, have always had an open ear toward the community, accepting feedback and tweaking the game according to the majority opinion, as well as implementing player-made items through the in-game store. SOE even displays the game's official ""roadmap"" on their website, allowing players to view the game's update schedule, as well as voting individual updates up and down and giving feedback on said updates, thus giving the developers an idea of what the community wants to see in the game.I mentioned an in-game store. This may lead you to believe that this game is slanted in favor of paying players. This is mostly untrue. Every player has access to every game-changing piece of gear in the game. The only things that are exclusive to customers who use the game's premium currency, Station Cash (SC), are cosmetic items (camoflauge, decals, vehicle horns, etc.) and consumables which increase the player's multiplier at which they earn experience. Players can also elect to subscribe to the game's subscription model, earning themselves a persistent experience boost which lasts until the subscription ends, 500 SC per every month subscribed, and priority in the queue to warp to an already-full continent once a slot is available. Fortunately, the game is entirely enjoyable without any premium benefits, and most players are perfectly happy having not spent a single cent in the in-game store. In the end, all you would be paying for is minor convenience, rather than game-breaking premium exclusives.Planetside 2 has quickly become one of the best games I've ever played, and I encourage anyone who has even a slight interest in the concept of an MMOFPS to give it a shot.",1, inkling interest games like battlefield series wish scale bigger game entirely persistent individual squad entire team impact game planetside mmo planetside delivers experience social long lasting bigger names mmo market like world warcraft eve online final fantasy xiv online fps planetside draws loved mechanics heavy hitting genre changers like battlefield halo duty modern warfare game absolutely unique comes gaming landscape truly comparable original planetside exclusive mag far smaller feature rich planetside past years planetside seen numerous updates range new weapons vehicles gear entirely new continents reworkings existing continents mechanics change foundation game works lattice update larger scale continental lattice game optimized run better alpha beta stages development operation faster game omfg series patches sony online entertainment planetside developers open ear community accepting feedback tweaking game according majority opinion implementing player items game store soe displays game official roadmap website allowing players view game update schedule voting individual updates giving feedback said updates giving developers idea community wants game mentioned game store lead believe game slanted favor paying players untrue player access game changing piece gear game things exclusive customers use game premium currency station cash sc cosmetic items camoflauge decals vehicle horns etc consumables increase player multiplier earn experience players elect subscribe game subscription model earning persistent experience boost lasts subscription ends sc month subscribed priority queue warp continent slot available fortunately game entirely enjoyable premium benefits players perfectly happy having spent single cent game store end paying minor convenience game breaking premium exclusives planetside quickly best games played encourage slight interest concept mmofps shot

1118,12831,12835,Fallout Shelter,"I was originally going to write this game off as just another mobile microtransactions cash grab, but Bethesda has surprised me with this one. There is absolutely no reason to use their in game store, the game does a pretty good job of standing on its own two legs. The game starts with a decent enough tutorial, and there is no penalty if you want to reset your vault because the drops weren't terrific. Base building is fun and addictive, and the downtime that plagues mobile games (which is how they rope you into buying things from their store) is actually pretty acceptable, given that they throw in the Mysterious Stranger (who gives you caps if you click on him) and the Disasters, which often require your attention as you send your Dwellers to fix whatever the situation is.Quests and Objectives are nice, as they grant tangible rewards, unlike venturing into the Wasteland, which is dependent on the Explorer's Luck Stat (which is likely to be low, unless you got a good Dweller from the Lunchboxes). Even though the Wasteland's rewards are RNG dependent, they do exist, and a good haul (especially the outfits) can really bump up Vault production.I think the only real gripe I have is that the bedrooms have a nasty case of catching fire (and not in the good way) which is odd to me, considering I've stopped placing people there since I built the Radio Room. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I'd like to find the idiot who keeps leaving lit cigarettes by the bedsheets.All in all, I fully recommend this game if you're looking for a free time sink. And like any mobile game, I also recommend staying the hell away from the in game stores.

1126,7625,7629,Trove,"Trove of adventures!As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?Graphics:If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.Gameplay:Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.SoundFX:While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.PTW or FTP?:This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.Personnal notes:This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. Be warned, it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg.

1147,9225,9229,PlanetSide 2,"I love this game s here a few thoughts why.Pros:Massiv scale with infantery, vehicle and aircombat mixed in. Looking for small fights? You find them on the less occupied lanes. Looking for several hundreds of players in one spot? Your covered as well.As a new player you start with the best weapon for each class! Every other weapon is just a sidegrad. Example? Medics are intended as supports and get a rifle thats effective close to medium range but you can unlock (through ingame currency or real money your choice) rifles that are better at hipfire and so in close range but less effective in medium and long range.You're an average or good shooter? You'll get tones of ingame currency to unlock what you want fast!You're a bad shooter? You're still covered! Either through using your skill to get close to enemies with light assault jetpacks or invisibility from the infiltrator and oneshot them from behind (there are certain weapons for that) or by supporting as medic and engineer or by deplyoing mobile spawnpoints or by playing artillery as a tank holding down shokepoints from afar and raking in kills and assists that way.Pro & Con:Outfits. Outfits are like guilds in any other mmo. Beeing in on makes planetside shine! Nothing greater than winning a figth while beeing outnumbered 3 to 1!Why that here and not in pro? -> Getting in one as a new player is confusing. There are some outfits that just want to be big and invite every new player they find but then you are in an outfit that most of the time hast several hundred or thousand inactive players and no leadership and organisation. Fun factor equals zero....So then without the game telling you how you need to leave the outfit and find a new one. If you have experiance in mmos it's easy but otherwise you got no clue since the game does not lead you.I love to unlock stuff! Games were i got everything bore me most of the time. Planetside has at the moment a really nice pace for unlocking stuff. It takes me around 12 hours to unlock the most expensive stuff at 1000 ingame currency and i am a medium good player. Meaning i have friend who are just half as effective and those who are way faster.You can't unlock class and vehicle upgrades with money. That is for me a good thing but others will be discouraged because there are some neat sidegrades for the vehicles and classes that take tones of time to unlock. Since generally the first and fith tier are the only noticable ones the in betweens sadly dont matter  most of the time on the other hand does that mean new players are competetiv from the start.You can buy weapons, implants, boosts and cosmetics with real money. I like that! You want something now? Buy it. Not necessary but helps especially when you start the game. As a long time player you now how to make certs in a fun way and when. As a new player thats hard and so buying sometimes help to have fun. Personally i started buying first after a few hundred hours as i noticed i want to stick to the game.The graphics still look really nice on the highest setting! But i personally can hit♥♥♥♥♥♥with all the light effects and recommend some of the optimazation guides on youtube or elsewhere. Helps a lot with fps and you get mor kills cause the other guy has nicer effects but you get the kill cause you can see him.Cons:You need a relativ strong new pc to run the game with high graphic settings and decent fps.Construction -> It is part of the game they infested much time in but... It is not good at the moment. In short you can build playermade structures of all kind and have really awesome battles there! Just theres no reason.... The only reason up to now was a building generating victory points. But... This building is so extremly easely killed (max crash google it if interessted) that building a real base was a waste of time. So you try to exploit the terrain and make it hard to reach with out building much else at all and then go somewhere else. Problem is you could defend against said max crash BUT frontlines are shifting and building a base right at the front is suicidal because building defence takes time and either the enemy rushes you or the front got pushed away by your allies.Worst part enemies tend to ignore your base because you get near to nothing for attacking it. Same for the defenders you get near to no points for standing there and waiting.Implants -> The only possible pay to win aspect of the game. Is it game breaking? No Since if you're the better shooter or surprised them or outnumber them or you sit in a rocket shooting aircraft while hes on the ground you you drop a grenade mine or c4 before his feet or... it doesn't matter especially in the big fights that make planetside so great! But in a small scale battle with even skill its sligthly annoying.As a new player just by playing you get a random selection of tier 1 implants. The highes tier is 5. You get more implants by winning alerts (playertriggered ingame events) and you get the second currency needed to upgrad thoses. Problem Tier 2 & 3 aren't worth anything the boni compared to tier 1 are minimal. Tier 4 costs 900 iso per implant and is a real upgrade. You get 100 iso per won alert, 50 for second place and 30 for last place. At best you could earn around 100 iso per hour but thats unrealistic. And tier 5 costs around 2000 iso. The tier 5 bonus is significant thou. SOOOOO why pay to win? An example are the implants battle hardend (reduces flinching while getting hit) and assimilate (you get shields back by killing someone with headshots) on tier 5 battle hardend gives you 50% reduced flinch from enemy fire same as tier 4 but on a kill that bonus is doubled making it easier to aim afterwards because you have just recoil to compensate for. Assimilate on tier 5 replenishes 200 from your 500 shields after a headshot kill and recovers 30% of your current special energy (healing for a medic, jetpacks for a light assault, overshield for a heavy and invisibily on an infiltrator).You can buy crates that hold aditional implants which you can trade for iso. These crates can be bought for 300 ingame currency for a small one (you should never do that bad trade) or for 750 ingame currency (takes me as an average player around 10 hours to earn) or you pay for them with real money for a random lootbox. meaning more money dumped equals a higher chance of getting the implant you want and having the resouces to upgrade them.

But to sum it all up: -Low Time to Kill (doesn't really matter what you build, you'll die within a second anyway)-Most movement parts feel very unresponsive and sluggish-Hard counter against air (Flak, Missles)-No skill and auto aim weapons (ION, PSK, Missle Launcher)-Totally unusable SMGs, which are supposed to be the jack of all trade weapons (inaccourate, crazy bloom and long bullet travel time)-Everyone can now be a one man army, since you're allowed to add as many diffrent weapons as you like-Top tier matches dominated by long range weapons (Rail)-Random LOOT CRATE drops are the only viable way to get new parts (only worthless parts noone would ever need, e.g. cosmetic masks, low tier stuff)Robocraft is basicially like Counter Strike, but all hits are like instant headshots (with the exception of SMGs) without even having to aim and sluggish movement (and therefore no way to actually dodge enemy fire). Well, and you can customize the looks of your player model, I guess?I used to play this game A LOT! I won't recomment this game to anyone anymore!

This is my review of ROBOCRAFT I am very expirenced in this game I have over 2000 hours :p (Yes for a while I did forget about a life) I have been playing since 2014 near launch back then it was a very fun game and no P2W at all. Yes their was grinding but not as much now. I personally prefer the old system for money it was better than haveing to grind for crappy crates. I think things went downhill after the META update the crates got added they changed alot of stuff and messed up the game and such. But as you can see much of the community has the same views as me so im going to have to say no to this game but as always it is up to you if you like the game. :),0, early access reviewhello review robocraft expirenced game hours yes forget life playing near launch fun game yes grinding personally prefer old system money better haveing grind crappy crates think things went downhill meta update crates got added changed alot stuff messed game community views m going game like game

If you have a few spare minuites I suggest you read this review.Let's take a time machine back to the end of 2013 I had just got into the PC gaming scene and decided to take a look at the most popular free-to-play games, sure enough Team Fortress 2 stuck out like a sore thumb and I immediately installed. My first match was completely outstanding and i'll always remember the rush I felt as me and my team mates pushed the objective on Dustbowl for the first time.Foolishly I thought i'd start with playing Sniper, but it was then I realised that each class was completely unique in their own way, they had both upsides and downsides. For example you have soldier who's capible of outputting massive ammounts of splash damage with his rocket launcher at the cost of only being able to have four rockets loaded at a time. And Engineer who's able to lock down entire control points with his sentry guns only to have them easilly destroyed by Spy or explosives. Don't even get me started on the amazing unwritten abilities that the classes have, for example you have Demo/Soldier who are able to utilize their sticky and rocket launchers to jump across the many vast and expansive maps. You also have scout who's able to use weapon combos like the Atomizer and the Force-O-Nature to practically fly across control points and avoid dangers below. In all Team Fortoress 2 will forever remain one of my favorite games of all time and has earned a place in the PC gaming hall of fame.",1, decided reveiw game spare minuites suggest read review let time machine end got pc gaming scene decided look popular free play games sure team fortress stuck like sore thumb immediately installed match completely outstanding remember rush felt team mates pushed objective dustbowl time foolishly thought start playing sniper realised class completely unique way upsides downsides example soldier capible outputting massive ammounts splash damage rocket launcher cost able rockets loaded time engineer able lock entire control points sentry guns easilly destroyed spy explosives started amazing unwritten abilities classes example demo soldier able utilize sticky rocket launchers jump vast expansive maps scout able use weapon combos like atomizer force o nature practically fly control points avoid dangers team fortoress forever remain favorite games time earned place pc gaming hall fame

1158,6793,6797,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewWell I gave it a good shot and played for 18 hours.Damage:You probably don't remember the days when Soldier of Fortune came out and you could literally blow the bad guys arms and legs off. Well I'm not looking for that, as there are kiddies present, but what I am looking for is some damage effect. Since when can a person get wounded by three or four bullets and still run, move and aim like a champion?HUD:So you've stealthfully walked, run, swam and crawled your way across half the map to capture a point and when you do a big circle appears over your head and tells every player on the map where you are. Almost as incoherent are the 'enemy spotted' tags which appear over your head if you ever dare fire your weapon. No matter how cleverly hidden you are, every enemy soldier on the map will see a nice red arrow pointing at you if you do. The only solution is to emulate the snipers who camp on top of a hill at the back of the action if you want to rack up the kills.    Tanks:The tanks are seriously over powered which ruins it for anyone in the infantry. This could so easily be balanced with early access to anti-tank grenades.Linear Warfare:The main disappointment for me is the linear battles where you must take point A before point B before point C etc. This makes it far too easy for the enemy to park a tank at point B or just pound it endlessly with shells knowing that if we fail to take that one undefendable barn then the whole battle is over.Conclusion:What could well have been a great open world game is now a counter strike clone with tanks that take no damage from rocket launchers. Spawn, get sniped, spawn, get tanked, spawn and get shot by the guy hiding in the loft where you spawned. I almost gave in and was going to spend some money to buy a shovel but thought better of it.

1159,14589,14594,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewIf we were back in time around 2014-2015, I would recommend this game. Now, it deserves to be un-recommended. As you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after Robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. I only started playing around mid-2014 and personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. I got the majority of my 116 hours of playtime in the first year since I got it. Now, the game has just gone downhill. Freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the Random Loot Crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. Before, you couldn't win a Battle Arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. Now, there can be one or two enormous Mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. Their recent update with the Random Loot Crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. Also, what they call the ""best"" player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best K:D ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. This increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates.  From the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a Premium account for the game. In conclusion: Robocraft was awesome. Because Freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not Premium. Now, Robocraft is horrible.  Because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. This game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: After months on end of ignoring the game, I forced myself to boot it up one more time just so I can see what's new and how the community has changed. Now I would like to declare that Robocraft has officially died. It's just not what it was before. Everything is different, in a bad way. This is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money.

Thanks!Great graphics, gameplay and atmosphere.You need to locate and track your pray, you can use everything from lures or listen for the calls certain animals do.The game takes Hitboxes to a new level, you can instantly kill animals with a heart shot, quickly put them down with lung shots and if you really have a bad angle or might not get a perfect shot you might hit the liver, stomach or instestines. Resulting in you having to track down the wounded animal.There isn't a hole lot you can do in the free to play mode except hunting muledeer and rabbit if you unlock the shotgun.If you want a better experience you need a starter pack, that will cost you at least 15$ so the game isn't really free to play. But you will have the tools to hunt everything in the game. BUT ONLY BUY IT if you actually find yourself enjoying the free part of the game.If you find it even more enjoyable after a starter pack you will probably waste your life and hard earned money on buying a weapon you really like from the game store.I put down a few hundred hours into the game, before it came to steam.

1168,2138,2141,Path of Exile,"I plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoA 100% free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character.

1180,6317,6321,Heroes & Generals,"Conceptually: Amazing war simulator with a fairly good strategy element to it as well as a decent focus on team play to take objectives. Classes of soilder are pretty awesome and fairly well balanced when everything comes together properly, couple snipers, some tankers, plenty of infantry, a few paratroopers, and a general heading the team. The period accurate weapons function exactly how you'd hope, innaccuarcy and all which can add to the feel of the game. The potentional for full war campaigns between the different nations present offers limitless battle possibilties.Reality: Teams generally end up unbalanced with your tanker being level one and having a crappy tank that gets one shot by the enemies max rank god tier vehicle which can also make things worse when just starting out in any class other than infantry. You end up just constantly losing over and over again to people who you really have no chance of beating no matter how good you are and then you level up at a snails pace but even after you get there you'll never earn enough credits to actually buy the stuff you need (credit costs for anything are insane and then they even threw in repairs). Yes your vehicles should be stronger the higher up you go, no you shouldn't be matching veterans with basically brand new players, especially when your equipment actually makes a noticable difference in your ability to play and when the servers are so unbelievably overloaded that there are 4k man queue times just to log in this kind of tier mixing shouldn't be happening.While I'm talking about the servers being overloaded, I should also mention they're complete crap...sometimes. As in every match you get into its a complete roll of the dice as to if your 5 ping actually means anything. With a constant 120 fps and an average of 10 ping I can barely move half the time because I'm getting ruberbanned left and right and even if I play sniper and just crouch down somewhere my targets are just warping everywhere so I still can't do anything. There have been multiple requests by the playerbase to prevent matching us into games where this is going to happen which would also level out the teams and possibly boost the community and overall player experience but these pleas seem to fall entirely on deaf ears.Overall: No, I can't recommend it because I simply can't see anyone really enjoying this game with its numerous problems. I know you see the good reviews scattered around but those people are, quite honestly, just lucky. They don't get placed in the games where suddenly nothing you do matters and everything is just going to warp around regardless of your connection. They don't get the games where your entire team is gimped with starter level players against a team of seasoned veterans. For most of us, at least half the time, we get into a horrible game with no chance of winning and barely an ability to move around just to try and at least enjoy our loss.",0, conceptually amazing war simulator fairly good strategy element decent focus team play objectives classes soilder pretty awesome fairly balanced comes properly couple snipers tankers plenty infantry paratroopers general heading team period accurate weapons function exactly hope innaccuarcy add feel game potentional war campaigns different nations present offers limitless battle possibilties reality teams generally end unbalanced tanker level having crappy tank gets shot enemies max rank god tier vehicle things worse starting class infantry end constantly losing people chance beating matter good level snails pace earn credits actually buy stuff need credit costs insane threw repairs yes vehicles stronger higher matching veterans basically brand new players especially equipment actually makes noticable difference ability play servers unbelievably overloaded man queue times log kind tier mixing happening talking servers overloaded mention complete crap match complete roll dice ping actually means constant fps average ping barely half time getting ruberbanned left right play sniper crouch targets warping multiple requests playerbase prevent matching games going happen level teams possibly boost community overall player experience pleas fall entirely deaf ears overall recommend simply enjoying game numerous problems know good reviews scattered people honestly lucky placed games suddenly matters going warp regardless connection games entire team gimped starter level players team seasoned veterans half time horrible game chance winning barely ability try enjoy loss

I racked up over 24 hours of play time in 4 days of trying the game.This game is hand's down the most frustrating and tear provoking game that invokes levels of nerd rage i did not know possible. Why is that?I'm glad you asked.This game has the depth, and pontential to be great. However as it stands the mechanics are god awfully skewed in a way i did not forsee. ESL has less RNG spam as Hearthstone, which should make it a better game right? Wrong. The impact RNG has on this game in a single play can decide an entire match based off 1 lucky RNG roll.The RNG mechanics of this game impact very high value moves. The rune system means if you get all 5 of your runes poped and no prophecy, and your opponet pops 2 of his, and both are prophecies you are done. You will likely not over come 2 free (often powerful) card plays. In the most critical of needs RNG will fail you. Absolutely, and unapologetically. Leaving you to go 10-15 game losing streaks. Intellect, stragey, tactics, and brillant deck building means nothing. In the end all that matters is luck. The only silver lining is that the P2Win fest that is Hearthstone is less applicable as even a dekc of 30 legendaries can, and will still get screwed by bad RNG rolls. ** One pro was the story mode, it was fun, and interesting. However over all this game falls flat on it's competitive play being decided for you. You don't decide anything, the draw decides everything. *** I once went 8 games in a row where i would get stuck with a 9 cost legendary in my first draw or intial hand in some way. I had 70 cards in that deck, and yet 1 out of 70 chances out of 8 games i got stuck with a useless card that caused me to lose vs opponents who always have the right cost cards for opening play.

There are many classes in the game, and more classes added regularly. Each class can be switched to ""on the fly"" all you need is a wardrobe. In Trove each player gets there own plot of land that they can take with them everywhere they go, all from the start! this land can be customized in anyway you can imagine as long as its withing the size limits. There are also shared worlds for building called Clubs, that act sort of like guilds in other mmos.  Linking all the worlds and features together is the hub.

1206,5182,5186,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewBrawlhalla is one of the most fun games ive ever played. It has many weapons and legends (the characters) to choose from to make every person worldwide, have a character that fits them. Every battle can and probably will be new and interesting. With tons of heartstopping combos, cool signatures, epic team matches and overall wonderful and blood-pumping gameplay. There is never a dull moment. The sastisfaction of sliding my grapple hammer on the floor scooping the enemy from the edge and watching them fly through the air as they explode into steam and stars while I give a thumbs up really makes the game fun! The game can frustrate you, but once you learn that using signatures (aka heavy attacks) often spell your demise, and the people you play learn that too. The game is not frustrating but fun! You dont say swears or other things along that line, You notice your fault. ""Oh! I didnt know that that Azoth attack hits twice! Now I know and ill be cautious!!"" Not to mention that (mostly) the community is extremely nice, saying ""GG"", ""WP"" and things like ""Wow dude! Sick  combo!"" Which really calms you down from the fight. However, like a lot of games, I suggest taking breaks, if you win a ton of times in a short amount and loose once, you flip. So take breaks. Overall the game is never dull, always updating and interesting, and thankfully, this game is how all online transactions should work.

1207,12169,12173,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewHonest review: 7/10 - TL:DR - Do recommend.

WoW - Gladiator S2-S5 - 75% server first raid kills BC - WotLK - Server top 10 level 70 and 80.Destiny - Full raid clears each DLC during their release. Terrible in PvPLoL - Platinum every season. 3500 normal wins 2500 dominion wins.D2 - 98 HC Sorcerer. Fortnite - I got a kill once.Wildstar - Max level medicPlanet Coaster - 450 hours playedSo, I've had my way around a lot of video games. Competitive and casual. That being said, Bless Online is good, and it can be great.Negative - The game launched with speed (and I'm talking Founders Pack launch, because as soon as it's available to public, that's launch to me). Servers sucked, instability was prime, I've played a ton of MMO's and other 'popular' online games. I'm used to this, I get it. Get over online games launch crashes. I know it sucks, we are all hyped.Positive - When you could play, it was fun. My favorite part of this game is the questing. And I hate questing. Okay, it's not my favorite, but it's not miserable. The game helps you out so much with what to do. Solely because of the ""Auto Path"" feature. What's that? It paths you, similar to RTS style pathing. You click on an area (or use the quest guide) and it runs you to where you need to be by creating a path. You don't have to do this, but it's super nice. ""Hey, I need to go over here. *hits auto path, alt tabs for a few minutes* Oh cool, I arrived (or died)."" Best feature in the game. It's what makes all the stupid bearable. Negative - They nerfed the damage a lot. Remember when I said the game launched with speed? Well you could kill the average mob in about five seconds. I play the Paladin, a healing class with the (probably) lowest damage output. This was nice. This was not the devs intention. I made it to level 30(?). They nerfed damage across the board. My paladin did 25% of the damage she did before. It made questing unbearable. And grouping up and sharing quests was a nightmare at the time. It was semi-buggy, kills didn't count toward each others quests, stuff like that. So they buffed XP gain a little. It was still bad. And I'm not complaining about the rate at which we are now leveling. I'm okay with the grind. I played WoW during its Vanilla days. I can get it can take eight hours to get a level. I'm cool with it. It just takes me, as a paladin, way too long to kill a mob. So I quest/grind four levels lower, where it only takes about ten seconds to kill a mob, ish. It's not fun. Nerf HP to all PvE mobs outside of dungeons by 50%, and nerf the XP to for all I care, that'd be fine. I'm okay with named mobs and specific mobs being hard, I'm about that. Positive - Mounts and Pets. You tame them. You select your mount from the wild. That's cool. The mounts have abilities. It's random (ish). You level up mounts. They have energy that depletes and they need to rest (or be fed). You have to ""evolve"" them, or upgrade them. This is a chance feature, and not guaranteed. This sucks. It's a luck based mechanic, which is okay, but you have only so many chances to do this, per mount/pet. So this will be a super long grind to get the ""right"" companion for you, because it may not upgrade. Maybe this will change a little bit, maybe not. This feature seems bogus. However, I'd rather have this than just ""oh look I have a mount now"". Negative - Everything seems to be 'temporary'. How do I explain this? Gathering plants and mining minerals. Your pick has ""charges"". It goes away after an hour, or so many uses, depending on what you buy. With my founders pack, my items are good for a month (infinite uses). This comes with Premium (the monthly sub). Also, durability reduction can be permanent. 40/40 on my weapon. Ten hours later, after being repaired a few times, 34/34. I think this can be fixed, I'm not that far in the game yet. Just seems tedious. Which brings me to the next thing:Positive (but barely) - Premium. If I am going to play a game, I don't mind paying for it. I don't mind investing in it. I like the sub idea. I like the sub idea being optional. You get better quality from a game if it is constantly making revenue. My best example: PS3 vs Xbox 360. I am a PlayStation guy. I like both, I have both (One and PS4), but I like PS better. However, Xbox Live was wayyyy better than PSN (before the PSN+ being required for almost everything). It was more stable, the matchmaking was better, it worked so much smoother. It's because people payed for it, so they kept working on it and improving it. PSN was free, and acted like it. It sucked. It was unstable and poorly set up. That being said, I'm okay with micro-transactions and/or subscription fees. I don't know how Pay2Win this game will be yet, but it is slightly. Premium is worth it. If you're too cheap to sub to an online game (be it any online game), that's okay! Don't complain about a measly 15 bucks a month. MMOs you play a lot. Pay for it. That's how they work. That's how the better ones endure. That's how they get better. Yes, you buy the game. You keep paying for the game to grow and get better. That's why people are not still playing FFX but are still playing WoW. This can go either way (+/-), but any game that is making many has a way better chance of getting better and staying a good game than games that don't. Positive - The game itself. The combo combat system. The unique spells. It's another MMORPG. I l like it. The talent tree like system is weird, I'm not a fan, but whatever. It's fun, it's kind of pretty. It's very bland as there are not a lot of ""extras"" in the game, only the necessity right now, which I don't care about. It's a fun MMORPG, gripes aside. I'm enjoying it. 60 hours in 7 days, playing fairly casually. Less than a dollar an hour. I'm happy with it. These are the big things about the game that would tip me either direction on the game. I haven't covered everything, nobody ever will. It's an MMO with a lot to do. The devs are making update daily, some liked and some disliked. They have an idea for their game. Be patient. Insert your opinion, let it be heard, but don't say this game isn't worth it because of an update you didn't like. MMOs are a longevity game. You play them for weeks/months/years, not two days. Play the game for a week before you decide to tell people not to play it. Say it's not for you, don't say it's not for them because you didn't like the patch the day it came out. .Again: 7/10, on the path to being better, a lot of potential to be better, but it's not bad as it is.",1, early access reviewhonest review tl dr recommend credentials bragging showing suck master wol campaign achievements wow gladiator server raid kills bc wotlk server level raid clears dlc release terrible pvplol platinum season normal wins dominion wins hc sorcerer fortnite got kill wildstar max level medicplanet coaster hours playedso way lot video games competitive casual said bless online good great negative game launched speed talking founders pack launch soon available public launch servers sucked instability prime played ton mmo popular online games online games launch crashes know sucks hyped positive play fun favorite game questing hate questing okay favorite miserable game helps solely auto path feature paths similar rts style pathing click area use quest guide runs need creating path super nice hey need hits auto path alt tabs minutes oh cool arrived died best feature game makes stupid bearable negative nerfed damage lot remember said game launched speed kill average mob seconds play paladin healing class probably lowest damage output nice devs intention level nerfed damage board paladin damage questing unbearable grouping sharing quests nightmare time semi buggy kills count quests stuff like buffed xp gain little bad complaining rate leveling okay grind played wow vanilla days hours level cool takes paladin way long kill mob quest grind levels lower takes seconds kill mob ish fun nerf hp pve mobs outside dungeons nerf xp care fine okay named mobs specific mobs hard positive mounts pets tame select mount wild cool mounts abilities random ish level mounts energy depletes need rest fed evolve upgrade chance feature guaranteed sucks luck based mechanic okay chances mount pet super long grind right companion upgrade maybe change little bit maybe feature bogus oh look mount negative temporary explain gathering plants mining minerals pick charges goes away hour uses depending buy founders pack items good month infinite uses comes premium monthly sub durability reduction permanent weapon hours later repaired times think fixed far game tedious brings thing positive barely premium going play game mind paying mind investing like sub idea like sub idea optional better quality game constantly making revenue best example vs xbox playstation guy like like ps better xbox live wayyyy better psn required stable matchmaking better worked smoother people payed kept working improving psn free acted like sucked unstable poorly set said okay micro transactions subscription fees know game slightly premium worth cheap sub online game online game okay complain measly bucks month mmos play lot pay work better ones endure better yes buy game paying game grow better people playing ffx playing way game making way better chance getting better staying good game games positive game combo combat system unique spells mmorpg l like talent tree like system weird fan fun kind pretty bland lot extras game necessity right care fun mmorpg gripes aside enjoying hours days playing fairly casually dollar hour happy big things game tip direction game covered mmo lot devs making update daily liked disliked idea game patient insert opinion let heard game worth update like mmos longevity game play weeks months years days play game week decide tell people play like patch day came path better lot potential better bad

1250,6911,6915,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"Honestly I have no idea how many hours I've logged in this game, but I truly cannot tell you if it's a good game. I've played since the beta using the bethesda.net launcher, but with each update I would be locked out of this game for some time despite all efforts  (including uninstalling and reinstalling the software). Now that my personal background with this game is out of the way, let me tell you about the Elder Scrolls: Legends. It's a card game (duh) featuring characters and monsters from across the Elder Scrolls series. Rememeber the Adorng Fan from Oblivion? He's in this game along with Cicero and Miraak from Skyrim. The Adoring Fan is just as annoying as he was in Oblivion so don't worry! See, he has special card attributes (known as keywords in ES:L) that make him a priority target. You have to kill the Adoring Fan before attacking anything else. In addition to this, he has another keyword that triggers when he is destroyed (called a Last Gasp) and his particular Last Gasp sends him right back into your deck to be played once you draw him again if you're lucky. Just like most card games, there is a hefty amount of luck involved. The rune system, combined with this ingrained luck, drives me insane. Runes work like this; both players have 30 health, and when a player's health is reduced by 5 points a rune is broken, allowing the player who is being attacked to draw a card. In addition to this, there are cards with the keyword Prophecy, meaning that if they are pulled from a broken rune, they can be played immediately without any magic cost. I'm not sure if I love this mechanic or hate it. I love it, because if you are being demolished you could turn a match around with a lucky pull. I hate it, because if you are the attacking player you can wind up being punished for doing well. In conclusion I love this game because I love The Elder Scrolls universe (I'm a lore freak), I love card games, and sometimes the rune mechanic works in my favor. Also, the deck building options are IMMENSE. I don't love this game when the rune mechanic DOESN'T work in my favor because I am a salty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and that's about it. TL;DR: It's a fun and free card game with beautiful artwork, great deck building possibilites, and a good story (set during the Great War before Skyrim). However, the rune mechanic can punish you for doing well in a match. PS: If I could have one thing added to the game it would be FLAVOR TEXT. Just a sentence or two on each card, something for a player to read in between matches.",1, honestly idea hours logged game truly tell good game played beta launcher update locked game time despite efforts including uninstalling reinstalling software personal background game way let tell elder scrolls legends card game duh featuring characters monsters elder scrolls series rememeber adorng fan oblivion game cicero miraak skyrim adoring fan annoying oblivion worry special card attributes known keywords es l priority target kill adoring fan attacking addition keyword triggers destroyed called gasp particular gasp sends right deck played draw lucky like card games hefty luck involved rune system combined ingrained luck drives insane runes work like players health player health reduced points rune broken allowing player attacked draw card addition cards keyword prophecy meaning pulled broken rune played immediately magic cost sure love mechanic hate love demolished turn match lucky pull hate attacking player wind punished conclusion love game love elder scrolls universe lore freak love card games rune mechanic works favor deck building options immense love game rune mechanic work favor salty fun free card game beautiful artwork great deck building possibilites good story set great war skyrim rune mechanic punish match ps thing added game flavor text sentence card player read matches

1274,9341,9345,PlanetSide 2,"I was hesitating to get this since I'm not really a fan of f2p games, especially not f2p shooters.After being massively bored with Overwatch and not having any idea what to play I stumbled over this game last week and thought ""I should at least give it a try"". I ended up binge playing the game ever since.This game has to be one of the most amazing shooters I played in a very long time (playing FPS ever since CS 1.6) and the teamwork is top notch.People actually do play their roles, engis run at you to throw you some ammo when you ask for it, medics actually do heal and revive you, people driving/ flying transport trucks or choppers actually do stop to let you hop in and then taxi you to the combat area.Whenever you help/ resupply/ heal/ revive your teammates, everyone is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing friendly and always saying ""thank you""...it's surreal almost. I mean, yes, it's just a small thing but it's outstanding in this game.I'm 40-50hrs in by now and I rarely have seen people actually flaming and insulting others.Granted, the graphics are dated, but I personally don't care. Coming from Overwatch (both PC and XB1) I've seen more teamplay in this game already in 50hrs than in 2 years of Overwatch and this is where the fun comes from.As said, graphics are dated (they are okay but nothing too fancy) but you have to decide what you want to play: a nice looking game that is just yet another generic FPS with stale gameplay and maybe a toxic community...or a fantastic team oriented FPS, that is fairly balanced with a fantastic community, where every class has it's pros and cons but with slightly dated graphics.I personally am having MASSIVE fun with this game.Give it a try, you won't regret!",1, hesitating fan games especially shooters massively bored overwatch having idea play stumbled game week thought try ended binge playing game game amazing shooters played long time playing fps cs teamwork notch people actually play roles engis run throw ammo ask medics actually heal revive people flying transport trucks choppers actually stop let hop taxi combat area revive teammates â friendly saying thank surreal mean yes small thing outstanding game rarely seen people actually flaming insulting granted graphics dated personally care coming overwatch pc seen teamplay game years overwatch fun comes said graphics dated okay fancy decide want play nice looking game generic fps stale gameplay maybe toxic community fantastic team oriented fps fairly balanced fantastic community class pros cons slightly dated graphics personally having massive fun game try wo regret

1277,14298,14303,Infestation: The New Z,"Infestation: The New Z seems good. I'm not a pro in survival/PvP games but here's my review.  Title Infestation: The New Z   Developer Fredaikis AB   Publisher OP Productions LLC, Fredaikis AB  Release 22 November 2016  Graphics 3D   Genre PvP  Price Free-to-play  Rating  6/10 The game.This game is an open-world zombie survival MMO with a heavy focus on PvP. Infestation: The New Z is an official reedition of Infestation: Survivor Stories, a zombie-apocalypse survival MMO PvP game. As its predecessor, it is set in Colorado and California. The New Z is the third edition of a zombie survival game that has been released several times.Gameplay.Infestation have a large open-world map where you can explore abandoned towns and cities and trek through desolate mountaintops and national parks while scavenging for supplies.The graphics seems pretty nice. They seemed soft and work well with the other players and zombies.The New Z offers beginner and warm-up servers, so new players can more easily get acclimated to the harsh environment, or you can try your luck on Battle Royale servers, pitting a number of survivors against each other in close-quarters death matches. Community features make it easy to find your friends, and you can create a clan for safety in numbers.You need to be prepared to engage in action-packed PvP almost anywhere in the map. Arm yourself with a variety of weapons from sniper rifles to frying pans. It's easy to get a gun. In a few minutes, I got three.While I played, the game runs well and I didn't see any problem. Just some FPS's oscillation but nothing too big. This leads me to think that the game is relatively well optimized.Bugs/aspects need to be improved.However, there are some bugs, e.g., sometimes there are crashes of updating the scenario or characters; the items go beyond the walls, which for me is severe because it can compromise a whole game, someone can be discovered in a hiding place because of this. Needs a quick fix.One thing I didn't realize is how the character runs so slow. There are a lot of zombies and you run slowly, and you still have to slow down to regain stamina. This could be improved.Positive points. (+)Free.Good interface design.Large Open-World Map.An enjoyable variety of guns and melee weapons.There's a lot of servers to choose from. You can get in to a super-populated one, or try to go it alone.Private Servers – rent password-protected servers to play solo or exclusively with friends.MLG Anticheat – the game is protected by an anti-cheat engine developed exclusively for the game.Negative points. (-)Bugs need to be fixed, like the crashes when updating the scenario.Unbalanced giant zombies, they can stay alive after three explodes and two hundreds bullets from machine gun.The world is big, and you run slow (and you have to take breaks to regain stamina). It can take a long time to get from one place to another, and most of the spaces between zones are completely zombie-free and loot-free. So, just big stretches of holding the run button, watching your stamina drain, so much time...Devs aren't the best, and maybe four years from now we'll still be reporting the same bugs.Good game to play with friends, as it alone can be hard.",1, infestation new z good pro survival pvp games review title infestation new z developer fredaikis ab publisher op productions llc fredaikis ab release november graphics genre pvp price free play rating game game open world zombie survival mmo heavy focus infestation new z official reedition infestation survivor stories zombie apocalypse survival mmo pvp game predecessor set colorado california new z edition zombie survival game released times gameplay infestation large open world map explore abandoned towns cities trek desolate mountaintops national parks scavenging supplies graphics pretty nice soft work players zombies new z offers beginner warm servers new players easily acclimated harsh environment try luck battle royale servers pitting number survivors close quarters death matches community features easy find friends create clan safety numbers need prepared engage action packed pvp map arm variety weapons sniper rifles frying pans easy gun minutes got played game runs problem fps oscillation big leads think game relatively optimized bugs aspects need improved bugs crashes updating scenario characters items walls severe compromise game discovered hiding place needs quick fix thing realize character runs slow lot zombies run slowly slow regain stamina improved positive points free good interface design large open world map enjoyable variety guns melee weapons lot servers choose super populated try private servers rent password protected servers play solo exclusively friends mlg anticheat game protected anti cheat engine developed exclusively game negative points need fixed like crashes updating scenario unbalanced giant zombies stay alive explodes hundreds bullets machine gun world big run slow breaks regain stamina long time place spaces zones completely zombie free loot free big stretches holding run button watching stamina drain time devs best maybe years reporting bugs good game play friends hard

1282,6638,6642,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewI really wish I could recommend this game. I really do. But I just can't. There are so many flaws in this game that just leads me to a 'No.'.The gameplay in this is actually pretty fun. It's not your typical COD game where you're a one man army (UNLESS you are a Pay to Winner, which is a different story.). There are multiple branches of the militaries, each with their own unique vehicles and weapons. Same goes with the three factions; United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union. But it just takes so damn long to level up it's a pain. All of these branches have a rank requirement, fyi. It took me a while to get to level 4 making around 400-600 of a score each round. I like a good challenge personally, but it takes such a long time to level up once you get there.Each weapon has its own different stats. Weight, space it takes up, damage, etc. One weapon might look like it sucks, and it might, but it's all dependant on how you use them. Some weapons might also one-shot you. It's annoying, even when you know you were at full health. But a headshot almost always one-shots. I don't know what else is happening, if it was in the torso. It's annoying as hell honestly, and some weapons need to be balanced.Pay to Winning is a constant annoyance. Yes, the game is free and the developers need to make money, I understand that. I even bought some gold to support the developers when I thought this game was good at the time. They are hard at work and do deserve it, but the P2W is just horrible. You could've JUST unlocked the 'Tank Crew' class and if you had enough gold, you could immediatly ""cheat"" your way to get the most powerful tank in the game.The quality in this game is meh. The graphics are pretty good for what it is. It isn't a top-tier graphical game, which I personally like as it doens't take as much memory and doesn't ruin your FPS. The gun sound quality though. I hate it. It sounds like you're firing a paint ball gun and nothing real at all. I don't care for this, but it makes me feel like this is something the developers neglected. Overall:  5/10. This game needs work. It has it's ups and downs. If there was a sideways button labeled 'Meh' I would've chosen it. But this isn't the game for you if you're not a patient person, or could easily rage. Play it if you want, but you will run into some problems.",0, early access reviewi wish recommend game flaws game leads gameplay actually pretty fun typical cod game man army pay winner different story multiple branches militaries unique vehicles weapons goes factions united states germany soviet union takes damn long level pain branches rank requirement fyi took level making score round like good challenge personally takes long time level weapon different stats weight space takes damage etc weapon look like sucks dependant use weapons shot annoying know health headshot shots know happening torso annoying hell honestly weapons need balanced pay winning constant annoyance yes game free developers need money understand bought gold support developers thought game good time hard work deserve horrible unlocked tank crew class gold immediatly cheat way powerful tank game quality game meh graphics pretty good tier graphical game personally like memory ruin fps gun sound quality hate sounds like firing paint ball gun real care makes feel like developers neglected overall game needs work ups downs sideways button labeled meh chosen game patient person easily rage play want run problems

1287,16871,16876,Cuisine Royale,"Access ReviewThis game may seem fun on the surface, and why wouldn't it? Great graphics, guns sound great, and who wouldn't want to run around while wearing a pot on your head? It all sounds great, until you realize the game controls feel like they were made for an Xbox controller, and climbing up ladders is absoutely abizmal. My friend and I came across a couple of bugs, the first bug we came across, I was on top of a car while my buddy was driving it, and he all of the sudden died, and it said it was ME who killed him. Another bug we came across was when me and him were crossing a bridge, and I just suddenly phased through the bridge. I couldn't move, I couldn't jump or prone or do anything to get out of it. The only reason why I was able to get out was because my friend drove up to me with a vehicle and I was able to get into it. If I was in a solo match, that match would have been done right then and there. On top of that, people are running around rampant with a golden pan that 1 shots people. In conjunction with them equipping boots of speed, which makes their movement speed 10x faster, virtually making them unkilliable. There are arguments on forums and threads saying ""git good"" and that would be true, IF IT DIDNT 1 SHOT. Atleast the framerate was good, and the sounds were awesome. There is talks of hackers running around as well, however, I've never seen or caught anyone that was FOR SURE hacking. I mean there were some pretty fishy moments but nothing really solid.

1296,1164,1167,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewReally amazing game. I bought it a few days ago and I am hooked. The game runs very smooth, and the gameplay is quite fun and engaging. In addition, at least playing in pubbie lobbies, ships seem to be fairly balanced, and it feels like every ship plays quite different from the others. This game plays a lot like world of tanks or world of warships, but with spaceships and with a 3D range of movement. However, it also has MOBA-esque qualities of having multiple ""lanes"" and having to push defensive structures to kill your enemy's main base. What makes this very enjoyable is the fact that you have to position, shoot and maneuver your ship on a micro level to defeat your enemy - but you also have to make sure that your overall map positioning and timing is good on a team level as well (i.e. making sure your team arrives at gamma together and on-time, making sure you are defending base when the enemy has access, etc). It can be a little daunting at first, but the learning curve isn't too steep, especially if you've played MOBAs and understand positioning, timing, etc.TLDR: Great game, plays like a mixture of world of tanks/warships combined with a MOBA-esque style.",1, early access reviewreally amazing game bought days ago hooked game runs smooth gameplay fun engaging addition playing pubbie lobbies ships fairly balanced feels like ship plays different game plays lot like world tanks world warships spaceships range movement moba esque qualities having multiple lanes having push defensive structures kill enemy main base makes enjoyable fact position shoot maneuver ship micro level defeat enemy sure overall map positioning timing good team level making sure team arrives gamma time making sure defending base enemy access etc little daunting learning curve steep especially played mobas understand positioning timing etc tldr great game plays like mixture world tanks warships combined moba esque style

1299,4613,4617,SMITE®,"Smite is a 3rd person MOBA drawing gods from various mythologies as playable characters. If you saw the word ""MOBA"" and immediately rolled your eyes, you probably shouldn't have, as this game is essentially the best MOBA for people who don't usually like MOBA's. The third person perspective makes the game feel more at home to people who play action games, and also make the game far more skill based as there are very few abilities in the game that aim themselves for you. In fact if you don't like the MOBA stuff at all you can easily play arena and be more or less rid of the typical MOBA gameplay, instead playing a sort of fast paced RPG Team Deathmatch. The third person perspective actually changes the gameplay cataclysmically, and if you've played DOTA or League of Legends before and you didn't like it, this one is definitely worth a shot.

1306,1709,1712,Dota 2,"Here is my problem with the recent addition of DotA Plus: Valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like DOTABUFF Plus and a similar program on OverWolf, and I believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). This was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. And now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price). There is nothing intrinsically wrong with DotA Plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. If people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. In fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like DOTABUFF that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. Theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. These programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. That's it. People have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now Valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.In other words, Valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). Scam if I ever heard one. Not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, World of Tanks for one example.",0, problem recent addition dota plus valve openly condemned use similar programs past programs like dotabuff plus similar program overwolf believe threatened given temporary bans people caught programs quote line heard rumors bans months ago vocalized newsletters sudden want ride hype train offering paid version players free addition accesories try justify price intrinsically wrong dota plus way offers unfair advantage increase damage gives rarely useful insight hero drafting people feel inclined spend money computer tell draft heroes jokes free versions available fact need program programs basically small fast windowed version websitess like dotabuff carry statistics winrates heroes common hero laning theoretically alt tab website type inconvenient takes longer switch windows type timely manner drafting phase programs eliminate inconveniences alt tabbing typing automates search heroes pops results wondow people gotten punished draft helpers long ago rumored people got temp bans valve decides turn blind eye pay type program added cosmetics words valve banned people free programs cheating come program order use need pay monthly subscription hero accessories scam heard supporting behavior games ruined actions like world tanks example

Initially the game was about building a robot which required you to have some skill and design ideas around it. You also had to actually aim your guns. There was a purchase system where you could purchase extra credits and premium to further on your designs or get that weapon you wanted.The most recent update to this game has brought fourth weapons you don't need to aim, robots you need no skill to fly and random chance on the blocks you to actually build your robot. But hey you can purchase crates from the pay store to hopefully complete the robot you have planned. I would suggest anyone very strongly to think again before spending any real life cash on this game as it will most likely be wasted by the developers on awful updates.If you want to check out the kind of feedback they have, go to their game forums.

Idfk, this game has made me speechless about making a review.I once make a review when i played it for 100+ Hours, and 350+ Hours, But this time i gonna make a really Serious Review about this.TF2 is Fun. Any game mode, any class, any server, It's a never ending Gameplay makes you feel like to play it more and more. Any weapons, any tactics, all exist, and they will keep growing.Community existed, and they are also keep growing too, and i am glad the community never dies even this game is lack of Consistent updates. Comnunity server is also fun if you want to play other than Valve's Official Game mode like VSH, Jailbreak, and theres many more you can explore.TF2 Competitive existed too (Community Competitive server, Valve's Version is a bit... bad.) And even Pro TF2 team & Competitive Match & Series existed too, but This game is more to Casual play, so you cant expect too much at comp, but hey, why not try it?I played this game for 1500+ Hours, and it will keep growing until i can't play this game anymore. I have played like CSGO, CoD MW2, BL2 and more FPS Stuff but i never stay in that game a very long time, and always go back to TF2.I still remember when my RL friends calling me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing this game. They say this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥but they never tried it. They play more to AC, CoD, BF and more ""High Class"" FPS, and i just play TF2. Now they stop playing those, meanwhile i still play this game even i have some hiatus by playing other game.Conclusion, i personally think this game is the best Game of the best game, and never makes me bored.

1318,15596,15601,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewFirst off all let's start with how AQW 2D has released items that do effect gameplay, and to make it worse these items go rare. They have xp boost items, gold boost items, rep boost items, and class boosts items. Most are locked behind being a member and paying a fee, or buying ingame currency to purchase these pay to win items before they go rare. Now this leads me to AQW 3D. The 2D game is unbalanced so why make a 3D version now? That kind of screams give me your money. Most things are super overpriced as it is. You have ultra hats in AQW 2D that cost 5,000 adventure coins. That is essentially 20 dollars for a super long hat... wtf? why...? I get that it's up to the player to buy these things and they have a choice, but to list something that high is kind of a joke to be honest. Why are you developing this 3D game when your 2D game is still in crisis? Most ppl pay lots of money just to enjoy and collect things from AE games lets be honest. So if you're prepared to spend lots of money to be at the degree of other players then go ahead play this game. This games micro transactions is almost a reminder of what Destiny 2 is not becoming.

1359,1247,1250,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewAlpha Review: Not representative of Final ProductFractured Space. What a game. I have bought 3 copies of the game, one Vanguard for myself and 2 Forerunner packs for friends. I've been a living, breathing advertisement for Fractured space and so far everyone I have recommended it to have agreed with me. Fractured Space is addicting. Gameplay - 9/10I want to give the gameplay 10/10 but I feel like some of the cooldowns are a little long when compared to others. For example the Phantom Ghost (And by extension the Ghost) has such a long cooldown on it's primary missles, which means after Ambush -> Missles you have to wait much longer than everyone else to start firing again. There are of course a few minor issues with balance with some ships but as for an Alpha game the game is amazing. The gameplay revolves around huge Space Battleships BLOWING EACH OTHER UP. What's not to like?Graphics - n/aI will give it n/a because there isn't many textures in the game. There are the asteroids, ships, mining/base ships and an endless expanse of space. Yeah. Exactly. With what we have, the graphics are great so there is no problem but I can't really review it. Matchmaking - 8/10I like the matchmaking, not sure why there is an MMR system with no ranks but oh well. The queues can take a while and I can't seem to stop the queue if I want to invite someone or search for Frontline/Conquest instead of vice versa. The games seem balanced usually but there needs to be a penalty for Disconnecting. In too many games does someone disconnect and there is only a 30% faster respawn time. We should get a damage buff for the loss of manpower too. If not then at least add a bot. It's better than nothing. Progression - 8/10The progression seems rather slow. I can't seem to discern how your performance changes your exp/credits earned because it seems about the same whether you win or lose (the only difference being you earn massively less when you lose). Then the exp for each faction takes forever to earn. I know you don't want people running around in the best ships right off the bat but it feels like I have been grinding for ages to earn my Watchmann. Overall score 9/10I REALLY want to give the game 11/9 but with the few problems that I mentioned above (as well as some FPS issues and PING which doesn't make sense. I get 200ping on London servers and 100ping on further away servers. I don't understand myself) however the game is a definite must buy. If they add a campaign it would only make the game better but I feel like they are going to go the Counter Strike route and not add a story, and just focus on the ships and gameplay which is already pretty polished.

1362,6544,6548,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewI love this game so much. And I like the fact you listen too the community as well. I would give this a 9/10. There is a few things a dont like, here is the list1. I unlocked the grease gun as infactry, didnt buy it. When I switched to a tank crewman, I had to unlock it again, which I dont think I have to do, since I aready did.2. It says tank crewman can use a semi-auto rifle. But it wont let me use my M1 Garand.3. I dont like the repair system. I like realism in a game, but that takes it a bit far. The reason I say this is beacause some battles a die a bit, use some gernades, ect. And at the end I can get 2-4 thousand credits. But with repairs I dont get much back, sometimes I lose money. So I suggest either remove it or make it so it doesnt cost as much.4.I think you should increase the amount of gold you get a day. You would have to do 1 battle a day for 20 days just to get 100 gold. And some people just dont have that time. So I suggest you increase it to 10 gold per first battle, so It cuts the time in half.5. I can feel the unbalance in battles. It seems the germans have too many tanks, and the soviets have to many half tracks.I know you guys are working on this and I am grateful for that. I think it should be like this, The germans have good tanks, but not much of them (Harder to get). The americans should have ""ok"" tanks, but plenty of them (Easier to get).Like how it really was in World war 2. As for the soviets, I dont know, I dont know what they had in WW2.Other than these few things I really enjoy the game and I hope you kepp on improving and updating the game. 9/10 IGN would definatly play again.

1364,12210,12214,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewLook I’m going to start off by saying the PR approach for this game was extremely bad. Take the criticism as it comes it will help you develop a better game.Gameplay in itself is okay if not a tad outdated. However questing is extremely broken and test translations felt like a google translate rather than someone actually translating it. Voice acting for this game is lacking, voices are emotionless and somewhat can add a little cringe factor there needs to be more emotion in the voice acting it feels like they are repeating the same lines over and over again getting bored.All in all this is still in early access and it’s pretty unpolished for something to be released to the public as a closed/paygate beta.Another thing before buying a founders pack is that you need to know that all your specials are one character only so pick carefully, to be honest though it’s quite a rip off with that case.Should you buy it now? Simple answer is no, wait another couple of months to let them have a chance at fixing it.",0, early access reviewlook going start saying pr approach game extremely bad criticism comes help develop better game gameplay okay tad outdated questing extremely broken test translations felt like google translate actually translating voice acting game lacking voices emotionless somewhat add little cringe factor needs emotion voice acting feels like repeating lines getting bored early access pretty unpolished released public closed paygate beta thing buying founders pack need know specials character pick carefully honest rip case buy simple answer wait couple months let chance fixing

1374,7902,7906,Neverwinter,"This game makes me so frustrated.  It has pros and cons, and if tended to could be so much better for players and producers. After playing various characters reaching endgame this is my conclusion-->PVE - Amazing tho a bit linear, still has good stories and quests compared to allot of other grinds out there.  I enjoyed many of the zones and contrary to many critics on vioce acting I didn't find it too bad.  Which is hardwork considering it's f2p.  Combat is fun and fast paced (not too easy, not to hard) and allows for some room to make character builds.  And if you have friends to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on PvE terms.  The foundry is one of the best aspects of the game.  It doesn't take a computer science degree to understand the fundamentals to allow for campaign creation. (However it does go down quite often which is unfortunate)PVP - *sigh*  This is the most damaging aspect of the game.  It has the potential to be great but anyone who plays who has not sunked 1k real money into will admit - ""Is broken""  Unbalanced and pure p2w.  Literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change.  Unless pvp is fixed the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it is already and continue until gone.   But in overall opinion it is a fair f2p game but has the potential to be one of the best if handled better.",1, game makes frustrated pros cons tended better players producers playing characters reaching endgame amazing tho bit linear good stories quests compared allot grinds enjoyed zones contrary critics vioce acting find bad hardwork considering combat fun fast paced easy hard allows room character builds friends play choose pay money climb game extensive pve terms foundry best aspects game computer science degree understand fundamentals allow campaign creation sigh damaging aspect game potential great plays sunked real money admit broken unbalanced pure literally post post thing change pvp fixed competetive fan base dwindle like candle continue gone overall opinion fair game potential best handled better

1378,15584,15589,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewBefore anyone says ""oh it's in early access, you shouldnt judge it so harshly"" early access isn't armour for criticism, plus I'm sure the people at Artix have their big boy pants on and can take a crticism or two.Firstly, why am I playing an android/IOS MMO on my PC?At this point Artix should have the money to make a decent 3D MMO, at least on the level and scale of world of warcraft or guild wars 2. (they may not be good examples, but the point still stands)So why are they making an MMO for mobile devices? Granted it's a lucrative market at this point, but why then release it on PC? They could have just released it on the play store and itunes, released updates, and just have it make money where it should.Secondly, why does the game look terrible? Like it looks worse than runescape! And thats saying something!I ask that question, but then I remember they are making a mobile game....for the PC....It's not stylised in a way that would hold up either, it just generally looks bad, like PS1 early days of polygon sprites bad.Finally, and this can be pointed to it being in early access, but there are lots of other early access games that passed this hurdle, the gameplay is completely un-inspired and pointless, you have a total of 5 skills for each class and 1 of them is always the auto attack, there is no variation to it and overall it leaves me bored, I'm not expecting it to make any big waves, but even the original AQ holds up better than this.In conclusion, it's a boring, ugly, lame excuse for a PC port of what has been done several times over, a hundered times better on mobile devices.

Apparently, in War Thunder, a tank can take 5+ shells to the engine and still operate, A tank gun can take 3+ shells and still operate, and a tank crew can take an unlimited amount of shells until every last member has been knocked out. I pelted so many tanks with shells that there is no way they should have been able to move even without killing the crew. I put 15 shells into 1 tank (I did not aim at the same spot twice.

1405,8396,8400,Neverwinter,"Neverwinter is a pretty standard Cryptic MMO in that everything about the game is incredibly mediocre. The game isn't your typical ""hotkey MMO"" - you instead have only a handful of abilities at any given time. Because of the lack of keys I found combat to be very boring and repetive, but for people that don't really like the ""bazillion and one things to remember"" it may be a good thing. I personally wasn't a fan of it.A lot of assets are reused as well. For 30 levels I found myself fighting the same types of enemies in the same types of enviornments, and story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. Very little of the source material is actually important, the game is essentially a self-contained story and even simple things like the city of Neverwinter itself is built from the ground up to be unique, so people like myself that played Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights etc. really have nothing to look forward to in terms of revisiting these locations.Classes are very bare-bones right now, and while variety is well enough, it doesn't even begin to compare to the kinds of options Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate players are used to. The ""die rolling"" character sheet on character creation exists, but it doesn't feel like actual dice rolling. It seems as though Cryptic made it so there are several chances you can get and the game just flips between them to simulate you're rolling your stats. I spent maybe ten minutes re-rolling to get an unoptimal roll and it simply never happened. My highest numbers were always on my classes two highest stats, with one or two points favoring one statistic over the other. I never managed to get really high Charisma on a Fighter, for example.The biggest comparison I can make to the combat system is Tera. The game has an ""active"" style attack and offense system in place, but for the most part I experienced no challenge whatsoever in a solo enviornment. In groups all of the content I experienced was trivial (especially in raids etc.). Maybe this changes as you get higher into the game, but I spent my 30 levels bored out of my mind and completely uninterested in what was going on story-wise. If you're new to MMOs in general, I think you will have a lot of fun, however. It strays far enough from the ""WoW-clone"" formula to be appealing in my opinion, but at the same time it doesn't take any huge liberties with gameplay mechanics or... anything else, for that matter, to really justify choosing to play this over the plethora of other MMOs that are available. Cryptic's use of the license is just pathetic, really. Apart from seeing ""Neverwinter"" in dialogue or on the map I was convinced that this was just another generic D&D inspired gameworld. When it comes to ""is it ACTUALLY free to play?"" I found the game to be pretty fair compared to other experiences I've had with this genre. At no time did I feel like paying for something would make the game easier, nor did I feel it was necessary to progress. With the research I did (I didn't spend dozens of hours on forums or Google so take this as a subjective opinion) the vast majority of things in the game that could be bought for real money were mostly convienence items. More bag space, faster mounts, armor/clothing cosmetics, that sort of thing. The game is using Cryptic's infamous ""lockbox"" system, however. And the middle of my screen was essentially permafilled with ""SO-AND-SO OPENED A BOX AND GOT STEAMING PILE OF DUNG"" so if you're not a fan of that type of marketing then beware that this game is very bad about that.In terms of content I found that the game was somewhat lacking. Crypic's ""mission creator"" system I experienced from Star Trek Online is present here, and it seems as though it's essentially been copy & pasted. This I found to be both good and bad. Good in the sense that there are really creative players out there that are doing Cryptic's job for them, bad in the sense that when anybody complains there ""isn't enough content"" most retorts will be ""then play community-made content"". The missions I played by players were varied, and while I never tried to make any missions myself, if the mission variety is any indicator, then Cryptic's tool is very versatile and seems to get the job done well enough.With that being said, it brings me around to my least favorite aspect of this game: the dailies. At an incredibly early level (approx. level ten) you are introduced to daily quests. If you're not familiar with daily quests, they are essentially very basic, oftentimes simple (but time consuming) quests that can be done on a timer (typically 12 to 24 hour period cooldowns). In Neverwinter the dailies revolve around PvP and player-made content. Once the initial ""new"" feeling wears off (just as any other MMO) the dailies become monotonous and tedius. The rewards are fairly bad as well, and never motivated me to invest a lot of time to complete them. Overall I was very disappointed in this game, and Cryptics consistency with creating average MMOs that adhere to a very strict formula. Being big into Neverwinter Nights I was continually let down with this game's lack of story and of license use, and in general the ""safe"" way Cryptic approached yet another MMO. Even more so since it lacks the sort of exploratory freedom of Star Trek, and the creative freedom of character of Champions Online. This game is a middleground to both of those games and as a result I feel it suffers for it. For the reasons listed above I simply can't (and won't) recommend this game to anybody but those that are extremely tolerant and/or accepting of the ""standard MMO business"" that has become so mainstream. And for those that are D&D enthusiasts, my advice, from one D&D fan to another, ""move along; there's nothing to see here"".",0, neverwinter pretty standard cryptic mmo game incredibly mediocre game typical hotkey mmo instead handful abilities given time lack keys found combat boring repetive people like bazillion things remember good thing personally fan lot assets reused levels found fighting types enemies types enviornments story compelling interested little source material actually important game essentially self contained story simple things like city neverwinter built ground unique people like played baldur gate neverwinter nights etc look forward terms revisiting locations classes bare bones right variety begin compare kinds options neverwinter nights baldur gate players die rolling character sheet character creation exists feel like actual dice rolling cryptic chances game flips simulate rolling stats spent maybe minutes rolling unoptimal roll simply happened highest numbers classes highest stats points favoring statistic managed high charisma fighter example biggest comparison combat system tera game active style attack offense system place experienced challenge whatsoever solo enviornment groups content experienced trivial especially raids etc maybe changes higher game spent levels bored mind completely uninterested going story wise new mmos general think lot fun strays far wow clone formula appealing opinion time huge liberties gameplay mechanics matter justify choosing play plethora mmos available cryptic use license pathetic apart seeing neverwinter dialogue map convinced generic inspired gameworld comes actually free play found game pretty fair compared experiences genre time feel like paying game easier feel necessary progress research spend dozens hours forums google subjective opinion vast majority things game bought real money convienence items bag space faster mounts armor clothing cosmetics sort thing game cryptic infamous lockbox system middle screen essentially permafilled opened box got steaming pile dung fan type marketing beware game bad terms content found game somewhat lacking crypic mission creator system experienced star trek online present essentially copy pasted found good bad good sense creative players cryptic job bad sense anybody complains content retorts play community content missions played players varied tried missions mission variety indicator cryptic tool versatile job said brings favorite aspect game dailies incredibly early level approx level introduced daily quests familiar daily quests essentially basic oftentimes simple time consuming quests timer typically hour period cooldowns neverwinter dailies revolve pvp player content initial new feeling wears mmo dailies monotonous tedius rewards fairly bad motivated invest lot time complete overall disappointed game cryptics consistency creating average mmos adhere strict formula big neverwinter nights continually let game lack story license use general safe way cryptic approached mmo lacks sort exploratory freedom star trek creative freedom character champions online game middleground games result feel suffers reasons listed simply wo recommend game anybody extremely tolerant accepting standard mmo business mainstream enthusiasts advice fan

1418,4306,4310,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"The game is designed and ran in such as way as to separate you from as much money as possible. Decks are being power-crept out of the game practically every month, with a slightly more efficient otk build being released in every new box.

If tails, you go second and otk them for the win, if heads, you go first, watch your board get wiped, and otk'd.

Personally, I think it's the best game in the genre, and it's constantly being updated and improved.  The story is great as you discover the tragic history of Wraeclast, through encountering relics during your playthrough.  The storytelling is uniqe, and it is mostly done through voiceovers so there is very little interference in actual gameplay.   The skill tree is massive and may be intimidating at first, so try going into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and saving it to your favorites, then referring to it when you level up.  You gain skills through gems, as well as ways to improve those skills by linking your gems together on your armor and weapons.

1430,1013,1016,Fractured Space,"so... I see that the developer is updating the game and upgrading it and what not..... BUTI started playing this game 2-3 years ago and ok, I was new and in development. Then devise optimized it and added ""for laptops"" feature, basically scaling everything down so it's less hardware heaviest. But at the time game wasn't that balanced so I left my second visit after a year. This is my 3rd visit and I see that game progressed a lot. New menu UI and a lot of graphics elements added. That being said, its more hardware heavy now... AGAIN. All of that would be OK if I had graphics options that would render my game playable. I forgot to mention that I'm playing on IntelHD 5500 integrated gpu. So... I would recommend adding more options to ingame UI, and graphics alike and solve problems that game has:-ton of (motion)blur (I dont even have an option to add/remove this♥♥♥♥♥♥ its just eating my gpu power and its just blocking my vision)-camera angle (I wonder if devs had this in mind; just like in TestDriveUnlimited I would like to adjust how high or low would I like my ship to be on my screen, I have found myself trying to scroll my wheel to zoom out as much as I can just to get that little extra clear vision on whats around me, Its difficult to see when my ship is half of my screen)-locked camera zoom value (I dont want it to reset every time I die)-greater zoom out value (just like camera angle, a little bit more options cant hurt)-FOV (this all depends on personal preference, I like it high and some people like it ""normal"")-corrected graphics option values (whats ""low"" to these devs is ""high"" in normal games, when it comes to weaker hardware, of course I want to make it playable)-optimized laptop mode (I guess that goes with correcting gfx options but now I dont have a feeling that this option works since the game looks better with laptop mode ON now then it used to look with laptop mode OFF a year ago)I bet all of this can be corrected in 2 days with few simple lines of code, Im not asking for quantum tech coding here. Im looking at this Fleet Pack but of course there is no point in purchasing it since I cant even enjoy basic things.

1436,15738,15743,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewHave always loved the meta 4th wall breaking dialogue in AE games since the original Adventure Quest flash game ages ago, and now they are bringing it to a 3d mmorpg?! Love the simplicity of the game and the traditional mmorpg flavor, meaning lots of grinding, but its done well so it feels rewarding and enjoyable.  So far the community has also been great, and friendly for the most part (there will always be trolls somewhere lol).  My favority part is I can login and play on here when at a pc and I can login with my tablet at any time without any issues, and the same account, same friends, def true cross platform.Right now its in open beta, so that means lots of stuff will be added, including but not limited to at least 100 total player levels, tons of new classes (a lot from Adventure Quest Worlds even), trading, group/party system, minimum level requirement for specific instances(keep those lowbies from ruining the raids), housing system, item fusion(keeping the look of an item but stats of another), raid events/dungeons etc.It is free 2 play and they are keeping to the idea that the only thing the paid for currency Dragon Coins can be used for is for convenience such as buying a craftable item without grinding for the materials for it, xp potions and some aesthetics.So far however there is one class (Guardian) that is only available as a purchase, its great tank class and has its own quests and what not associated with it as well and as far as inforation is available is the only class that will require payment for, like a dlc.  I thought it was worth it to support the devs, and if you do not have it you are not really losing out as it does not provide the best gear in the game it just provides some awesome looking gear.  And if I remember correctlyl there will be dozens of classes anyways, so 1 that you have to buy to support the devs in my opinion is fair (and worth buying and supporting them for).The best part for me, it works very well on our crappy computers at work, rather it actually works on them lol, and it works fluidly on my tablet, so something I can enjoy playing without technical limitations or control/mechanics limitations.If you love traditional mmorpgs, you love hats, you love awesome armor and weapons, or just want to be able to get your mmo fix on the go, this is the game for you.

1446,10981,10985,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewAs an ex mtg player and card game lover, I really do love the concept of this game. The game is set similair like that of magic where there are 5 colors which each do their own things to various extents. The game has a nice deck building feature which you can make decks or varying colors and see what little combos you can make. Which was the selling point for me for awhile. Such as the g/w legendary temple speaker and the w legendary acedant you can basically draw almost all of your deck out by simply shooting all your destiny lands out and drawing a card to replace the destiny land AND a card for ascendants empower. However the severe issue i have with this game is the lack of deck shuffling interactions there are, mainly because the biggest issue in this game is sigil screw (drawing all sigil or none for 4+ turns). Now some say that shuffling the deck wont matter as you can't see what's inside your deck or the order. Well that is true however magic players would know that shuffling is also a form of rearraging the deck to simply just change the odds in the deck as it stands, ie* When i go to draw a forest out i dont search the first forest but see clumps of lands and grab one from those. Except in this game when i play the 1 mana seek power, I get a sigil of my choice RANDOMLY from my deck, meaning it could be a mana from a clump of 5 or a land from my next draw. Which brings me back to the lack of deck interactions in the game, there is no way to shuffle your deck so once the game starts you are stuck with the order that the game shuffled it which tends to always have land clumps by the dozen of 2-4 lands meaning you could get 12 lands in 12 turns with no way of stopping it. Another thing is the fact of seeing what cards are in the deck through some spells does incur an imbalance of card knowledge, in g/r you can see the top card of your deck if you have buffed it, ie* warcry. Meaning if i play the 4 mana search a unit or weapon from my deck, I can see all my units and weapons. From there I can see which ever weapon or unit is buffed then that would be my next card to draw. So thus I would avoid picking that one and choose another, thereof affecting the entire game through an unfair advantage of knowing what is in your next draw. It is knowledge any other player wont have and due to the non-shuffling implement they get that card.So as much as i love the mechanics and deck design and card interactions, I can not get past this lack of deck shuffling mechanics. As it stands the most frustrating aspect of the game is the least worked on with no hopes in the future of ever being fixed. Perhaps if they change the deck shuffling feature the game could hold up hope but as of now is just another chernobly waiting to happen.

1452,8615,8619,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewYou can go back through the timeline to say which game copied who. People say this is a Fortnite Clone, but H1Z1 came out before Fortnite. So is Fortnite a H1Z1 clone? This logic can go back to the beginning of Video Game time. There's no harm in variety of a genre.Review: (Assuming you and someone else has equal aim skill) it comes down to who has the better armor + weapon rarity. However, you can double dash as a warrior in their face to keep them on their toes, teleport through windows as an assassin for faster looting, dash straight up in the air mid shotgun fight as an engineer to confuse them, or *run* mid-fight as a mage with her limited flight ability.Once you're out of health, you've become your worst nightmare. A target for spinning sword attacks. However, you and your fellow chickens can't swarm in from the heavens like Ocarina of Time. You'll have to hide like a sneakyboi pubg style (the chicken doesn't make much noise standing still).If you've waited out that timer, congrats now you...""need healing"".A fun, extra, in-game concept is the use of your mount. If you get tired of DayZ running in Realm Royale, just hit that ""Z"" (or Zed for all you Canadian Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) key to pull out Roach! Now you can gallop ""around town with the horse you love"". You can use this to run from gunfights, however, that would be detrimental in improving your aim.So if you're tired of the toxic, trash-talking H1Z1 wanna-be Nurse Disrespectors out there, the slithery snails of PUBG sunbathing in the grass waiting for a prey to come by, or 11 story themepark-mansions that people build in 4TNyt.

HiRez needs to develop a way for people to understand how to play the game. As a Master Conquest player this Season peaking at 50th in the world ranking, I understand this game more than anyone can hope to understand a game.  Even in the highest level of games players still don't udnerstand fully what to do. They need to pay people like me or other well known players to create videos teaching players how to actually play Smite. Game has a great casual side. Matchmaking can be very poor at times because of lack of players at times. HiRez genuinely seems to be a good company other than minor slip ups. Stop promoting Paladins and your card game. Those games are jokes and a waste of time and money. Smite is a gem and could become the next big thing. Will it though? I see a bright future for Smite, but until this game is HiRez's only focus, time will be of the essance until this game dies out or is taken over by another ""action MOBA"". After having atleast 2000 hours on this game (Non steam hours are a thing) this game will ALWAYS have a place in my heart.

It has a lot of potential in that it can expand on with a storyline that keeps you intrigued, learning about your individual race you play.Pros- Fun combat- Fun story- Detailed character creationCons- HORRIBLE CONNECTIONSTo expand on this con, the game just crashes every once in a while.

1475,4033,4037,Team Fortress 2,"As things stand on day one of this update I cannot recommend this game.If I could get a refund on the money I've spent in the store I would do.I know I'm a late comer to the game so I got it for free but between my account and my son's I've spent ~£100 on this game.  To me that means this game was not free, I chose to support Valve by spending money in the store, I bought a stamp (was considering buying more) and I spent money in the community market.My number one gripe is the locked first person camera mode while you are dead, this causes me motion sickness - this is a showstopper for me.Number two gripe, the insane waiting time to get into a match.  Does it help much to know there are over 800 players near by that are ""compatible"" and over 3500 empty servers?  No, that's just enfuriating.Choosing all core game modes to theoretically maximise my ""compatibility"" still resulted in a 30 minute wait time.  I ended up in a game mode I have never played which meant a map I didn't know so (even if you discount the motion sickness) I had a really poor game experience.  I know which game types I like (CTF and occasionally Payload) so I had a 66% chance of a crappy game.Compatibility?  Damn game sounds like a dating app.Number three gripe, I can no longer just sit and play on one server for a few hours with a bunch of people who ""just want to play"".  I agree that can end up with some pretty poor teams but even they were better than having a 50% chance of ending up in a game type I don't want to play and being force to play it or be penalised with a ""leaver"" debuff.Even if the wait times were down to sub three minutes I still want to be able to choose my game type, I like CTF, I want to play CTF.

1495,9823,9827,Elsword,"Wost MMO i've played in a LONG time. FREEMIUM and PAY-TO-WIN at its finest. Most free MMOs have paid ""cash"" items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in PvP or not I don't care its still BULL. This game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will LITERALLY TELEPORT BEHIND YOU breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests DON'T work properly, the options don't work properly. Now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for SOME games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2D and 3D moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to PAY for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you PAY for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or PAY to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the UI is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left CTL for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute I got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. I love MMORPGs but this is the WORST I have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will NEVER PLAY AGAIN. Only reason why I played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others MMOs with each other for a week. In short: God this was utter trash and a NIGHTMARE to play I never want to play again nor probably never will.*I was playing Add which is supposidly a ""mage class"" apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther MMOs because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game DOESN'T show your max HP so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much HP you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 SECONDS even if you have 3 DIFFERENT potions on your quick slots they ALL go on cooldown, if the potions REGENED health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.",0, wost mmo played long time freemium pay win finest free mmos paid cash items cosmetic changes look cool games cash items actually stat bonuses work pvp care bull game bugged funny combo based game enemies literally teleport breaking combo enemy teleports enemy come trap combo death enemies solid objects walk knocked try jump maps stagger knock enemies enemies wo quest system buggy event quests work properly options work properly bugs problems game defaults windowed mode screen option work restarted granted usual games combo based game moving map map takes forever slow map moving pain rear pay win equip skills want pay item inventory tiny expand pay size inventory items drop basically forcing sell entire inventory pay expanded tutorial sucks tell game key binds obvious sense game absolute horrible job showing health potions useless heal easier die respawn right died penalty reprocussion come health mana ui user beginner friendly tutorial help basically need come womb knowing play game look play beginner constant tutorial flashes skill set gets annoying playing hours telling hit left ctl skill time playing froze minute got starting town cause friend sent party friend invite froze randomly middle playing time came love mmorpgs worst played absolute garbage horse dung probably play reason played friend deal play mmos week short god utter trash nightmare play want play probably playing add supposidly mage class apparently mage health normal mages otther mmos potion healed barely healed hp game max hp hard tell need guess hp potions second cool seconds different potions quick slots cooldown potions regened health different story cooldown fine

1497,17457,17462,EverQuest II,"In the sake of full disclosure Everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life.  With that said, and me having gone deep into EQ2 I thought it time to write a proper review of MY take on the game good, bad, and the so so.I found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly.  The game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.The amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable.  Over 25 classes (only 1 or 2 need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and 21 races (2 of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available).  An let's address that quickly.  Yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, 2 races and 2 classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka ""rent"") and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts.  HOWEVER, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over 100 to 200 hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see 10 years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids.  Now I went sub, ( I choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations I did not want.  However, again I stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like Skyrim and have over 150 to 200 hours of free content to see and experience.An while the style of game is dated after 10 years and the combat again very classic Everquest or World of Warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus.  I do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more ""alive"" like Guild Wars2 or Rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.For people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (75% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience.  You can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo.  Since this game has been out 10 years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.The only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being 10 years old at this point is the dated UI (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd.  Definately advise you find a good community, active player base since I think (I do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on.  However, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.Overall, while this was not Everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the Everquest saga before the next chapter in Everquest starts.  To any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world.",1, sake disclosure everquest original game heart experience memories great fun wonderful community getting past bad terrible times life said having gone deep thought time write proper review game good bad found game holds graphics music zone immersion tricky mmo guge single player rpg capture correctly game better job recently helping showing starting zones skills combat crafting gathering types game play wanted fan mmo game races classes game incrediable classes need baught game cash shop races cash shop need baught available let address quickly yes best things cash shop races classes best housing monly game cost gold solver aka rent conveinces things like armor skins cool mounts free play players fun vast open world experience easily hours content player wants simply level cap years worth zones dungeons quests raids went sub choose pay monthly play free play players use chat options limiations want stress free play player come treat game dungeons raids aside like skyrim hours free content experience style game dated years combat classic everquest world warcraft plus minus want stress point modern mmo fans looking world static alive like guild rift coming recently mmo people wanting play eyes best voice acting holds quest s voice acted great great immersive zones music strong personal world story experience hire mercenaries aid quest dungeons level dungeon later solo game years hundreds zones dungeons areas lands public non instance dungeon zones private instance dungeons experience bad dissapointing aspects game game years old point dated ui add ons fix quest mapping tracking awhile understamd definately advise find good community active player base think know sure thousand million players zone felt saw people zone eager help talk new players overall everquest game look forward spending year missed enjoy chapter everquest saga chapter everquest starts fan old school mmo single players wanting vast world explore far far worse spend time vast wonderful world

As you level up, you'll be able to move some teams around on the RTS map yourself, and give your FPS player some backup/respawns etc. The three factions fight for control of Europe, which you win by capturing the majority of the major cities on the map.Expect there to be changes to the gameplay, they intend to change it a lot as the game develops.

1503,8945,8949,PlanetSide 2,"After sinking over 1,300 hours into the game I have decided that I may as well write a review, the big question is where do I begin? If you are a new player planning on playing Planetside 2, go right ahead, the first hundered hours that I played this game where filled with the most rewarding, atmospheric and epic gameplay experience I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy in any multiplayer FPS game. Witnessing my first zerg was quite a sight to behold, the battlefields of auraxis choked with armor, infantry and aircraft amazed me as I had never witnessed anything of the scale. Battles that rage for days where both sides get pushed back and forth with the ebb and flow of the red tide of blood was really quite a thing to witness. The unknown lands that seemed to stretch into infinity, detailed as far as the eye could see. I was simply astounded by the scale and atmosphere.Soon enough I met some players on my faction that invited me to an outfit, we became very good friends and remain so to today, even though we don't play Planetside very much anymore. The satisfaction that comes with accomplishing tangible goals through teamwork is definitaly the most rewarding part of the game, wether that goal is as simple as destroying an enemy vehicle or as profound as shifting the tide of a battle where hundereds of players are engaged. These victories are truely the best part of Planetside 2.Unfortunatly Planetside 2 is not without it's problems, many of which are so embedded into the core of the game that they are un-removeable. The realization of these has turned me into a grizzled veteran in the war on Auraxis, I simple can't go back to those first hundered hours. The massive scale of PS2 often leads to one-sided battles where the losing side is totally outnumbered and are pushed back base after base untill the amass enough players to engulf the enemy in an even bigger swarm. The unique armament of the waring factions ensures that one side will always have somthing very powerful that the others do not. The gameplay balance is in a constant state of flux, doomed to forever nerf and buff, never achieving true balance. The grind can be quite painful at times, especially for new players, this only encourages new players to use the cash shop to purchase weapons and EXP boosters with their own money. The player classes are in no way balanced, one being much more powerful than the others.Despite all this I would still reccomend you playe Planetside 2, even with the poor balance and painful grind for EXP. Cherish the good moments in this game and try not to take it too seriously, find a faction you like and join an outfit. Don't spend money untill you are sure you will play for a while.I'm not sure what the future will hold for Planetside 2 but I'm sure as hell that I'll want to be there to witness it.Live free in the NC!",1, sinking hours game decided write review big question begin new player planning playing planetside right ahead hundered hours played game filled rewarding atmospheric epic gameplay experience pleasure enjoy multiplayer fps game witnessing zerg sight behold battlefields auraxis choked armor infantry aircraft amazed witnessed scale battles rage days sides pushed forth ebb flow red tide blood thing witness unknown lands stretch infinity detailed far eye simply astounded scale atmosphere soon met players faction invited outfit good friends remain today play planetside anymore satisfaction comes accomplishing tangible goals teamwork definitaly rewarding game wether goal simple destroying enemy vehicle profound shifting tide battle hundereds players engaged victories truely best planetside planetside problems embedded core game un removeable realization turned grizzled veteran war auraxis simple hundered hours massive scale leads sided battles losing totally outnumbered pushed base base untill amass players engulf enemy bigger swarm unique armament waring factions ensures somthing powerful gameplay balance constant state flux doomed forever nerf buff achieving true balance grind painful times especially new players encourages new players use cash shop purchase weapons exp boosters money player classes way balanced powerful despite reccomend playe planetside poor balance painful grind exp cherish good moments game try seriously find faction like join outfit spend money untill sure play sure future hold planetside sure hell want witness live free nc

1511,12838,12842,Fallout Shelter,"   I've played all the Fallout games, from the main series to the spin-offs, and I have to say this game is rather enjoyable. I started playing it on my phone, but decided to play on the PC because it makes my phone die in a few hours. I like it because I can spend 15 minutes to an hour playing, making progress without much effort, basically great for casual play. I personally have not had any issues on PC, but from what I read, others have, something about losing all progress and saved games being delete. From my experience both phone and PC, I have never lost my saves, but one time on my phone I had progress lost for some unknown reasons; during an update it happened.     I never purchase anything from the store, and the proof is in the last achievement I will never get. Apparently, you have to purchase or obtain a ridiculous amount of lunchboxes to get all legendary dwellers...LoL, good luck with that... I have had over 50 lunchboxes obtained by questing and objectives and only have 4 legendary dwellers; just 16 more to go... I guess that means I need to get 200+ more lunchboxes.    The RNG on the pet drops sucks too, I have about 10 useless pets and 12 useful ones. Getting good pets is like finding gold bars, all parrots, anything with + damage resist, +damage, + wasteland goodies, + healing,  -crafting time, and -training time is what you want. Unfortunately, +rad healing, +twin chance, +happiness, or Poodles, Persians, Dalmatians, and German pointers can go away, because they suck for long-term vaults. As of right now, after 100+ hours of playing, I have 2 Persians and 4 Poodles, and it sucks that the RNG on my carriers were wasted on them. Recently, I figured out that if you open a lunchbox before you open a carrier, your chances of getting a different pet increase, instead of getting useless duplicates all the time.   Some of the quests are comical, every now and again I do a ""Ah ha"", at the cheesy jokes. Also, some of the quest test your understanding of Fallout lore from other games, mostly from the main series of 3+, don't expect to see stuff from 1 and 2.   Aside from all the negative stuff I said, I like this game. If you're looking for casual play, you will probably enjoy it too.

I even added on a few months more and enough virtual currency for an additional firearm I was curious about.I haven't been counting, but my guess is I've paid around $50 or so and already have about 100 hours of gameplay.

1537,1587,1590,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewHi,Today I will make a review that I hope won't bother you too much. This game is one of the most special games I have ever played on my pc. The mechanics of the game I stunning as well as the graphics which are well optimised for Amd Gpu. Now that sound good I guess. The problem is find with the game is the lack of realism and the control of the ships you should have. The spaceship is stunning but the interaction with other ships and the outers pace environment is not that great. The metorits are too easy to avoid and they are too big. Maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship. Now the next part is of course the game play.  Now this is interesting because it was difficult for me to decide. First of the loading times to find players is ridiculous but understandable for a game that is not a hit yet. The interface inside a battleship match is not as user friendly as you might expect but it is okay. The game is actually not boring at all but fun as heck. You can enjoy 1 game of fractured space and it will feel like you played for 10 hours. This is good for those gamers who  don't have more time than 1 hour a day to play games. Now last problem I have is with people that are AFK. There should be a system that bans them after they're kicked from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour. I would say that this game is worth playing. You can enjoy the game without putting a penny in buying the great editions of the game. I would give this game a 6/10. This is pretty good score for a free to play game.

1547,10601,10605,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewEdit2: I am again updating this review, since i think the game has changed somewhat since my last one:After a season of imbalance and a meta which became so stale it was virtually reeking, a new expansion brought a fresh breeze into the entire game again, shaking up some things, while strengthening its core of ""infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game"" as they write it themselves. With the introduction of the ""Fall of Argenport"" (i think it actually has a decent lore, though this is not the main point), the developers managed to rebalance a lot of the game, offering new possibilities for deckbuilding and making a wider, more interesting veriety of decks viable, which gives me the feeling, that it now reached its best state yet. This is the main reason i feel very positive about recommending it (again).However, i am aware, that the ongoing expansions come at the increasing cost of accessibility for new players, because it needs more and more investment either in time or money to get the cards you want, as well as becoming more difficult/ needing more experience to understand which cards may benefit your decks more - though this is basically true for any CCG. So i am wondering, how this will be addressed in the future and where the game as a whole might still go from here.Edit1: I was dissapointed for a while that, while a couple of updates brought changes, they didn't seem to address some of the major flaws of the game. This changed with the recent update (1.18.2), as they implemented a counter measure to the infamous ""mana-screw/ mana-flood"" problem and they even expressed some thoughts on their approach. So, while i still think that more can be done, the devs have proven that they listen and try to respond, which i think is a good reason for further recommendation.It's the younger, sexier cousin of MagicIn short, Eternal is a must try for every digital CCG enthusiast and i think there's no reason for others not to try it as well. I bet, or at least hope a lot of people will get hooked by it.The strengths of Eternal probably aren't the graphics or sound, they're decent enough, it looks nice and the sound probably won't hurt your ears, though i've muted it for the sake of my own music after little time and it could look a little better or worse, i think it wouldn't make much of a difference, because those aren't the core of Eternal's experience. I'd say, that's where the mechanics and accessibility of the game are.The comparison of Eternal to Magic: The Gathering definitely isn't farfetched. I've very actively played Magic for a couple of years some time ago and when i first played Eternal i immediately felt at home - which is not at all surprising, since the devs are Magic-players as well. Many mechanics are similar: The turn structure is almost the same, mana is called power, there's flying, trample is called overwhelm, haste is charge and there are many more in slight variations. So, if you really don't like Magic, you might not like Eternal, but i'd say you should still try, considering Eternal kind of looks and feels like the younger, sexier cousin of Magic, who offers some moves which feel familiar, but a bit different at the same time and who promises improvement during joyful consenting playtime, where Magic might feel like it's trying too hard to impress, just to grab your money.The whole structure of the game often makes it feel a little slower than other recent CCGs and the resource mechanic can lead to frustrating bottlenecks in play if you heavily draw against the odds, but on the other hand i'd say there are a lot more possibilities to combo and build various decks with interesting strategies. I think it is rather well balanced, though there are certain cards which result in hefty power spikes and some i'd consider useless (as is often the case in most CCGs). But there is no card, deck, or strategy which can't be beaten by others, the game usually isn't decided in just a couple of turns and every turnaround can feel satisfying.And, as rarely as it happens, i'd actually consider this game free to play, as you not only can get everything the game has to offer without paying anything, the rate at which you gain cards is actually pretty good, i'd say generous, which makes it possible to get strong/ tier 1 decks relatively fast and to experiment often.And, well, if the current mass of positive reviews haven't convinced you to try and you haven't turned your back already because you hate CCGs in general, i honestly don't know what will change your mind.",1, early access updating review think game changed somewhat season imbalance meta stale virtually reeking new expansion brought fresh breeze entire game shaking things strengthening core infinite possibilities deep strategy card game write introduction fall argenport think actually decent lore main point developers managed rebalance lot game offering new possibilities deckbuilding making wider interesting veriety decks viable gives feeling reached best state main reason feel positive recommending aware ongoing expansions come increasing cost accessibility new players needs investment time money cards want needing experience understand cards benefit decks basically true ccg wondering addressed future game dissapointed couple updates brought changes address major flaws game changed recent update implemented counter measure infamous mana mana flood problem expressed thoughts approach think devs proven listen try respond think good reason recommendation younger sexier cousin magicin short eternal try digital ccg enthusiast think reason try bet hope lot people hooked strengths eternal probably graphics sound decent looks nice sound probably wo hurt ears muted sake music little time look little better worse think difference core eternal experience mechanics accessibility game comparison eternal magic gathering definitely farfetched actively played magic couple years time ago played eternal immediately felt home surprising devs magic players mechanics similar turn structure mana called power flying trample called overwhelm haste charge slight variations like magic like eternal try considering eternal kind looks feels like younger sexier cousin magic offers moves feel familiar bit different time promises improvement joyful consenting playtime magic feel like trying hard impress grab money structure game makes feel little slower recent ccgs resource mechanic lead frustrating bottlenecks play heavily draw odds hand lot possibilities combo build decks interesting strategies think balanced certain cards result hefty power spikes consider useless case ccgs card deck strategy beaten game usually decided couple turns turnaround feel satisfying rarely happens actually consider game free play game offer paying rate gain cards actually pretty good generous makes possible tier decks relatively fast experiment current mass positive reviews convinced try turned hate ccgs general honestly know change mind

You have to walk very slowly and quietly so you don't scare animals... even before that you have to find tracks and track the animal. Also, just becouse you shoot an animal doesn't mean you kill it.

1549,1041,1044,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewWhile I didn't play for very long, it was like a complication due to the manner in which I was playing (over a verizon dsl network, streaming from a windows 7 pc to a windows 8 laptop). The main problems I encountered were a slow network connection (from the router, not the game), fuzzy graphics that did not want to play nice and display properly on my laptop (likely a result of not configuring them properly on my desktop first, or even having to do with the router again), and dropping from games in the middle of a fight (Which I can blame on verizon, once more, but it may have had to do with the game itself).Overall, I would recommend this game. The gameplay I did experience had a focus on teamwork, on strategic maneuvering to enable you to appropriately apply the force you had at your disposal from flying a capital ship, and, well, 3 dimensional movement in space combat is always nice. This game is for you if: You have the patience to play a moderately paced game, are willing to work with your team mates (even if they are strangers), and have been looking for something that focuses on large ship space combat. This game will not scratch your itch if: you are looking for a game like tie fighter vs x wing. You will not by flying small, fast, fightercraft and engaging in dogfights. And that's okay. There are other games that do that, some in space, some not so much. War Thunder (last I played) did a very good job in giving you planes to fly around and dogfight in. Overall, it looks like a game with a good amount of potential that has already lived up to a fair bit of it. It's an early access game, so expect bugs, but the features that are already in (from what I've seen) lay out the foundation for a solid game.",1, early access reviewwhile play long like complication manner playing verizon dsl network streaming windows pc windows laptop main problems encountered slow network connection router game fuzzy graphics want play nice display properly laptop likely result configuring properly desktop having router dropping games middle fight blame verizon game recommend game gameplay experience focus teamwork strategic maneuvering enable appropriately apply force disposal flying capital ship dimensional movement space combat nice game patience play moderately paced game willing work team mates strangers looking focuses large ship space combat game scratch itch looking game like tie fighter vs x wing flying small fast fightercraft engaging dogfights okay games space war thunder played good job giving planes fly dogfight overall looks like game good potential lived fair bit early access game expect bugs features seen lay foundation solid game

1575,15612,15617,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewNow I was very hopeful going into this, knowing full well that it is a very early access copy. Adventure Quest worlds was one of the more entertaining browser games I ever got to play as a child and I was very curious to see just how that would translate into a modern, 3D image as a whole. However, I still find myself disappointed, just not for the reasons you would think.I. The Combat and The Controls1. the combat - I personally had no quarrel with the controls or the combat style of the game, keeping in mind that the game's design is ""True Cross-Platform"". If I had to comment on it? It's not a very good idea to have everything limited as though it was a Mobile only game. What does this mean? Well, the HUD is exactly what you think it is, four to five buttons on the bottom right corner detailing your different abilites (Of which there are really only four for every class as the fifth button is your Auto-Attack), and your health and mana bar (Both of which seem very insignificant, as unless you're heading into very high level territory, there really isn't anything that can pose a threat to you. Not to mention, it seems next to impossible to run out of mana unless you're fighting a boss mob...) As someone who's playing on PC? It's not that I'm expecting TONS more from a game that's programmed to work on a Cell phone, however it still feels like Artix PARTICULARLY focused on the mobile aspect. Now I can only imagine this will change in the future, when the devs have had more time to properly work on the game. For now, however, it feels like the only thing that's keeping Personal Computer users in mind is the fact that there's a controll scheme set up for them. Speaking of which...2. The Controls - Again, I have no major complaints here, save for the fact that they are far too simplistic. For a game Like AQ? I do expect more than just click to interact and press a button to attack (at least, outside of their 2d games, which even then had more interactive capabilities than this). This is another case of the game being too one sided towards the IOS side of the target audience. I still think that there will be improvement, and it would be unfair of me to not give the developers time to do so. However, it's still upsetting that it feels like the game was released into beta far too early, given that they desired to capture the attentions of two separate users. Let's take a look at some other aspects of the game, yes?II. The GraphicsAgain, definitely one-sided towards mobile users. BUT (and a big one too) there's no denying that this is almost a necesity. I definitely don't find myself complaining too much, as adavanced graphics for PC users is something that can be integrated in the future (Like just about everything else that needs to be added to the game). It's art style is simplistic, but still reminds me of the AQ universe I explored when I was younger. There really isn't anything more I can say about this section really. NEXT!!!III. The World ItselfHow can I put this gently...? It's empty. Like, completely empty, and almost entirely devoid of NPC characters that are designed to be interacted with. In Battleon (The MAIN town in the game that AQ is known for), I found more hostile NPCs than anyone to talk to. It seems they have many areas for the game already designed, but they have yet to fill them with characters that either give you quests (To which there is at least one per area), shops (of which there are next to none, ESPECIALLY for low level characters that often depend on at least one or two buys so they can last long enough to get armor from grinding, something rather redundant as the first shop that actually has any of this only sells things that you can very easily grind for), and overall life to the region itself. Battleon is a town that looks like it was abandoned in preparation for a full scale war. Oh, did I not mention that? All the non-hostile NPCs in the town are just generic guards that cannot be interacted with... I'm starting to ramble, next section!IV. QuestsFor a game called Adventure QUEST, there really aren't that many quests. Every single one I ran into was either a fetch mission or a ""kill this many of this enemy"" mission, both of which are flawed in a few ways. Fetch missions can be completed far too easily, as the items needed are LITERALLY POINTED OUT TO YOU. Meanwhile, hunter quests are just the opposite. -""Kill this many of that monster"" -.... Okay... Where is the monster? -""........."" -That's it? how am I supposed to find it if I don't even know where it is? - "".........."" ... The fact that I ran into this exact same predicament at least five times before even ending an hour? Not too good. Again, and I can't really stress this out enough, the game is in an EXTREMELY early access build, so I can't really say I'm entirely dissappointed- as there really wasn't much to expect in the first place...V. ConclusionOh, we're at the end already? That was fast.... Anyway, despite all that I've negatively mentioned, I like the way that this game is heading. I really do think it has potential, and I cannot truly blame the developers for any of it. My final conclusion is that the game was released into its public testing phase FAR too early. Essentially, there isn't really anything to test yet. As you can most likely read on the top of this review, I haven't even played for a full hour. And yet, I feel like I've already done everything the game currently has available to do.Artix Entertainment had once managed to capture my young, feeble heart with the majestic browser game known as Adventure Quest Worlds. Even if I didn't know what I was doing, there was enough in it to keep me at least guessing what I had to do. I would argure that for mobile the game would feel more complete were it not for the fact that I've played full scale MMoRPG games in the past on my phone that felt FAR more diverse than this.If I had ONE suggestion to make to Artix, it's this: Don't be afraid to add on to the game. Right now, I had everything on maximum and my computer didn't know what was happening as it had never run a game so smoothly before. The game is not in the least bit finished, much less finished enough for stress testing. There is literally nothing to test here guys!VI. Final VerdictDo I recommend the game? No. At least, not yet. I recommend that you keep an eye on the game and the progress of it's development, as I know for a fact that Artix is a company (If you can really call it that given how few of them there are) that likes to trully cater to its audience and try their very best to help them out wherever they can.

1581,15793,15798,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewI’ve not played much of this game, so its fair to say that I haven’t been able to experience all the features; however, I already see the aspects of the game which need emphasising and the problems of this game.The game is early access, so it has the odd bugs (a multicoloured polygon games springs to mind) but this isn’t something to get angry about in game before its official release. The team working on this is small, but the game is often updated, as is the outlined plan, and community engagement is fantastic from Artix Entertainment.It was the nostalgia of my playing AQ Worlds almost ten years ago that drew me to this game. It has some of the same charm and humour, but not to the same extent. At times the game can feel like its trying to hard to be what its predecessor was.The big question when it comes to this game is whether trying to make the game accessible for mobile gamers had limited its appeal and enjoyment for PC gamers. The answer, in short, is yes. The camera feels clunky and the game very much feels like its designed for regular visits and clicking which could be done on a small screen. The classic trope of MMOs, grinding quests, are definitely frequent, toward the point of tediousness. Some redesign is definitely needed in terms of quest placements and objectives. My main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quests (often quests are very small, possibly to make it them completable on the move) and so double the rewards for the remainder – with a slight increase in difficulty. I think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in terms of achievements rather than in gear. The game doesn’t feel like a life experience in the same way as other some MMOs and RPGS, including AQ Worlds does, but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task. Thus the problem is that the game feels far too much like a classic MMO and not enough like the game it could be; perhaps essentially what is needed is a slightly altered 3D version of the of Artix’s more successful 2D games.Another problem is the crafting system. When you collect enough raw material, NPC crafting shops can make this into gear, for a price. This is quite basic and nothing I really have a problem with. The issue lies in the need to wait a set about of time (a minute, an hour, a day, etc.) in order to collect your new gear. It slows the game, and when you collect the item, it can sometimes be that it no longer feels worth the time as you’ve levelled up and found new equipment to use.The question that I think it comes down to asking yourself is whether it is better to invest your time in a game mid-development, or a game in what is essentially the DLC phase; should you play AdventureQuest 3D or AQ Worlds. For me, getting back into the latter is very daunting, with so much content – one of the reasons I often avoid MMOs is because I feel so out of my depth when compared to players who have been around for so much longer. The 3D game is lacking, but it has fantastic potential, and will hopefully grew into the game it could be. It’s worth taking the time to try this game before dismissing it, especially for people who played Artix games some years ago.

1588,16469,16474,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Donald J. Trump Inauguration SpeechEvery four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent, thank you.Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there has been little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.This is your day.This is your celebration.And this – the United States of America – is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement –  the likes of which the world has never seen before.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighbourhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists.Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.We are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, we share one nation, one home and one glorious destiny.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation and their their pain is our pain; their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidised the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our own military.We've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power – from this day forward a new vision will govern our land – from this day forward it's going to be only America first – America first!Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down.America will start winning again; winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour.We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship good will with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of live on anyone but, rather, to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America. And through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice.The bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear: we are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly we will be protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over; now arrives the hour of action.Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail; our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.Together we will make America strong again; we will make America wealthy again; we will make America proud again; we will make America safe again; and yes – together we will make America great again.Thank you.God bless you.And god bless America.",1, donald trump inauguration speechevery years gather steps carry orderly peaceful transfer power grateful president obama lady michelle obama gracious aid transition magnificent thank today ceremony special meaning today merely transferring power administration party transferring power washington dc giving people long small group nation capital reaped rewards government people borne cost washington flourished people share wealth politicians prospered jobs left factories closed establishment protected citizens country victories victories triumphs triumphs celebrated nation capital little celebrate struggling families land changes starting right right moment moment belongs belongs gathered today watching america day celebration united states america country truly matters party controls government government controlled people january remembered day people rulers nation forgotten men women country forgotten longer listening came tens millions historic movement likes world seen americans want great schools children safe neighbourhoods families good jobs reasonable demands righteous people righteous public citizens different reality exists mothers children trapped poverty inner cities rusted factories scattered like tombstones landscape nation education system flush cash leaves young beautiful students deprived knowledge crime gangs drugs stolen lives robbed country unrealised potential nation pain pain dreams dreams share nation home glorious destiny american carnage stops right stops right nation pain pain dreams dreams success success share heart home glorious destiny oath office today oath allegiance americans decades enriched foreign industry expense american industry subsidised armies countries allowing sad depletion military defended nations borders refusing defend spent trillions trillions dollars overseas america infrastructure fallen disrepair decay countries rich wealth strength confidence country dissipated horizon factories shuttered left shores thought millions millions american workers left wealth middle class ripped homes redistributed world past looking future assembled today issuing new decree heard city foreign capital hall power day forward new vision govern land day forward going america america decision trade taxes immigration foreign affairs benefit american workers american families protect borders ravages countries making products stealing companies destroying jobs protection lead great prosperity strength fight breath body let america start winning winning like bring jobs bring borders bring wealth bring dreams build new roads highways bridges tunnels railways wonderful nation people welfare work rebuilding country american hands american labour follow simple rules buy american hire american seek friendship good nations world understanding right nations interests seek impose way live let shine example shine follow reinforce old alliances form new ones unite civilised world radical islamic terrorism eradicate face earth bedrock politics total allegiance united states america loyalty country rediscover loyalty open heart patriotism room prejudice bible tells good pleasant god people live unity speak minds openly debate disagreements honestly pursue solidarity america united america totally unstoppable fear protected protected protected great men women military law enforcement importantly protected god finally think big dream bigger america understand nation living long striving longer accept politicians talk action constantly complaining time talk arrives hour action allow tell challenge match heart fight spirit america fail country thrive prosper stand birth new millennium ready unlock mysteries space free earth miseries disease harness energies industries technologies tomorrow new national pride stir souls lift sights heal divisions time remember old wisdom soldiers forget black brown white bleed red blood patriots enjoy glorious freedoms salute great american flag child born urban sprawl detroit windswept plains nebraska look night sky fill hearts dreams infused breath life almighty creator americans city near far small large mountain mountain ocean ocean hear words ignored voice hopes dreams define american destiny america strong america wealthy america proud america safe yes america great thank god bless god bless america

But, unless you want to engage in a mind-numbing, one-arm bandit style gaming experience, steer clear. It's addictive and time-wasting. You get to the end only to find there is no end and that the best option is to save up gold for what would be a week for me at this point to have your highest character reset the world and do the entire thing over. Most of the time you don't need to do anything to survive a level. Clicking is a waste of time until you reach really high levels. Configure your team, make sure they are the best, hover over the game as it advances unlocking new chars and attempt to configure them to maximum advantage, then wait for the same series of things, over and over, ad nauseum. Or walk away for a week, come back and do the same things for two hours, realize you aren't getting any of this time back for better things, walk away for a week, come back, do the same thing over with the money you've saved, etc., etc. Meh.

1611,858,861,WARMODE,"Early Access ReviewRussian attempt at making basic counter strike clone. It is a bit unusual since it isnt p2w, but it misses core mechanics and anticheat. Menu is basically just a server list and a shop with real cash only skins. These have weird level requirement, but its easy to reach it. Skins go from 50 cents up to 3.5 dollars for the highest level skins. Skins look kind of decent even if they are same pattern reused a lot of times. Sadly they aren't in the steam inventory which makes them pretty much worthless, unless you really want to spend money on this game. There are also some hats and banners, which require payment as well.Game offers 4 different game modes: ""Deathmatch"" (team deathmatch), Confrontation, Sabotage (search and destroy/plant the bomb) and Zombiemode (pvp). I mostly found players playing deathmatch, there is very little of them left though.Now the interesting part, especially for a free to play game is that all the guns are bought and reset during the match. There is no inventory where you manage the guns in the lobby, annoying trial guns, p2w weapons or lucky boxes; instead you enter the match and gain 2000 points (depending on game mode) which you can use to buy some guns for start. The more kills you get, more money you gain progressively during the match which you can use to buy new weapons. These points of course reset for every match, so everyone gets a fair start.Gunplay felt lacking for me, the gunsounds were extremely bad, everyone was running around with knife trying to get some easy kills, since all it takes is one knife slice to get a kill. Running is just way too fast for game to be an enjoyable shooter. Most of guns have pretty horrible spread especially when moving, so you are forced to use ironsights which mostly block off your screen making it even harder to hit a target. Or you could try standing still trying to aim with crosshair while others are running to knife you and cheaters are noscope jumpshooting you.Warmode could've been at least a bit better casual shooter if it had any kind of anticheat and if devs didnt completely abandon it. Its only feature is that it isnt p2w, but thats about it. It held me for few minutes just so i could try out all the weapons.Pros:- Not pay to win- Weapons are bought with currency earned during match (works something like counter strike)- 4 game modes- Relatively decent looking cheap skins, available for direct purchaseCons:- No anticheat, cheater infested- Abandoned by developers- Small playerbase- Bad gunplay- Bad gun sounds- Small map pool- Running speed is too fast",0, early access reviewrussian attempt making basic counter strike clone bit unusual nt misses core mechanics anticheat menu basically server list shop real cash skins weird level requirement easy reach skins cents dollars highest level skins skins look kind decent pattern reused lot times sadly steam inventory makes pretty worthless want spend money game hats banners require payment game offers different game modes deathmatch team deathmatch confrontation sabotage search destroy plant bomb zombiemode pvp found players playing deathmatch little left interesting especially free play game guns bought reset match inventory manage guns lobby annoying trial guns weapons lucky boxes instead enter match gain points depending game mode use buy guns start kills money gain progressively match use buy new weapons points course reset match gets fair start gunplay felt lacking gunsounds extremely bad running knife trying easy kills takes knife slice kill running way fast game enjoyable shooter guns pretty horrible spread especially moving forced use ironsights block screen making harder hit target try standing trying aim crosshair running knife cheaters noscope jumpshooting warmode bit better casual shooter kind anticheat devs nt completely abandon feature nt s held minutes try weapons pay weapons bought currency earned match works like counter game relatively decent looking cheap skins available direct anticheat cheater abandoned small bad bad gun small map running speed fast

But it's not as it is now. The game auto levels you and chooses your skills which i very much dislike. The game lags terribly in the main city which is normal in most MMO's due to the population. The difference here is I was lagging A LOT but i didnt even see any other players. The combat is very linear in the sense you hit a button and just follow the skill chain. Button mashing at it's finest. I looked in the cash shop and it looks very pay to win at end game. Honestly it was just sort of boring and with the lagging and the fact I didnt see a single other player it's just not fun. So, I do not reccomend this game. However, if you feel the need to play it I'm sure you'll make up your mind within the first hour of playing that it should be deleted from your computer and sent to the recycle bin where it belongs.

1621,13510,13514,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very pretty game!  But I cannot in good faith recommend it.There are a lot of crafting options, things flow more or less understandably with the recipes being unlocked as you build things - not a huge fan of that, but it helps you understand the game so I'm alright with it.  Visually it's very nice!  But the problem is the combat system.Monsters have a much larger range than you and there are no effective ranged weapons, so I was forced to dash through enemies (there is no collision damage, the one small mercy here) while swinging and /hoping/ I hit - didn't always, because sometimes I would inexplicably fail to swing my sword for several seconds and then swipe at empty air.  And with limited stamina, every battle against an enemy that actually fights back - and all but three or four of them do - is a dice roll whether you'll be able to win before your dash meter bottoms out and you're murderized by a tiny evil piglet.There's no other tactic that seems to work, even circle strafing, as mobs seem to be able to hit you from any angle - and any elevation.  They're easily able to follow wherever you go, unless you outpace them or have a door to shut in their face, and some are small enough to slip through 1x1 gaps and terrorize you.  There's a severe disparity between monster health and damage output for the early game.  I'm not sure how it is in late game because I gave up after progressing to the obsidian tier, and that was enough of a problem as it was, requiring the consultation of a wiki to find the best places and ways to kill things and not die repeatedly.It's a shame the combat is so awful, because the rest of the game is really quite well-done - there are ladders with auto-snap, teleporters, really nice-looking decorations; you keep everything in your action bar when you die, just not your inventory; the crafting system isn't grid-based, so it doesn't feel like a direct rip of Minecraft; all these are nice things.  But ultimately, in order to progress beyond the very basic levels of interaction with the world, you have to kill things.  And that's where the game fails, and fails terribly.I wanted to like this, I really did.  But I'm not going to suffer through this horrible combat system any longer.",0, early access reviewthis pretty game good faith recommend lot crafting options things flow understandably recipes unlocked build things huge fan helps understand game alright visually nice problem combat system monsters larger range effective ranged weapons forced dash enemies collision damage small mercy swinging hit inexplicably fail swing sword seconds swipe air limited stamina battle enemy actually fights dice roll able win dash meter bottoms murderized tiny evil piglet tactic work circle strafing mobs able hit angle elevation easily able follow outpace door shut face small slip gaps terrorize severe disparity monster health damage output early game sure late game gave progressing obsidian tier problem requiring consultation wiki find best places ways kill things die repeatedly shame combat awful rest game ladders auto snap teleporters nice looking decorations action bar die inventory crafting system grid based feel like direct rip minecraft nice things ultimately order progress basic levels interaction world kill things game fails fails terribly wanted like going suffer horrible combat system longer

1632,12766,12770,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"The game was fun, but it ask too much for a computer, even a good one. The control are ok, but it having too much options and it pretty hard to memorize 30+ commands here, if you don't have a racing wheel for your computer, you're going to taste the wall all the time. It could be fun to see a gameplay that is keyboard friendly here, because the game seem to force you to buy a racing wheel. The graphics are great, the 3D models of the cars are amazing, and a lots of polygon are on them, but since they have a huge numbers of polygon, like I said before, even a good computer will suffer from video lagging. Frequent framerate drop also happen a lot(even during the loading screen)! Also, I feel a lot of time that the game look unfinished...Another thing here is the loading time, you will have so much time to cook a dinner since it took so much time to load!!!!The sound is ok, but I don't feel like I'm sitting in a racecar(I have a subwoofer, still, the sound have no bass sound). The motor sound flat, and not like a ""ROAR""!!!!The main menu isn't friendly at all, since with the new update, I got much more trouble to start a race than before, oh, and the stuff that need to be bought, like cars and tracks are not identified correctly...Another thing that not cool is to play online, you need to buy the DTM experience pack, isn't the game supposed to be free???I do not recommend this game for gamers that never played racing simulator before, but give it a try, maybe you will like it, maybe not.I prefer other racing simulator like Gran Turismo or Live For Speed(and LFS is keyboard friendly), but Raceroom Racing Experience is not a game, it a demo with extremely limited content if you don't buy the DTM experience...

1635,4008,4012,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2Two opposing camps and try to conquer territory or those of others to steal documents. This is not a big map, while the action is concentrated on a fairly small area and never on its own base line of the war you do not have to far. So little could be described as a system deathmatchová turmoil with very rigid constraints that determine the characteristics of the characters.Each of the nine occupations is completely different and presents a specific approach to playing. They pick all - born attacker reaches for ultra fast Scout, Soldier balanced with a rocket launcher or a flamethrower armed Pyro. Defenders choose your favorite HeavyGuy with oversized gun, a rogue Demoman with a grenade launcher, and on the walls fireable-holding mines. The third option is astute Engineer who can build a teleport station complementary health and ammo (Dispenser) or fatal loophole after the third upgrade capable of firing missiles.The last group of occupations will appeal especially calmer nature that play for the team and not rushing to the front line. They have a choice of Medic with its inexhaustible source of health and the occasional immortal effect. Of course not miss Sniper, whose professional look me after every execution can inflame red. And finally, virtually invisible Spy, who are attacking from a backup in disguise.MapsThe basic package includes six maps, which is quite a few. On the other hand, all radically different and shortly after the release occurred fan creations. The classic is the already mentioned 2fort, which will again become the most played of all - you know it from the trailers. There's no guaranteed recipe for victory and hardly anyone will be surprised by the unusual strategy. Dustbowl is a map of conquest points. One team defends, the other attacks. When you have some place you can not lose him and immediately move forward to conquer the next space. Thus, working through progressively up to six stations. The map is definitely interesting and the best part is the determination with which resists defending team at the last point. Has never happened to me that I would not much help the team conquered.Any negatives?It is very difficult to me to Team Fortress 2 find any bug. Aside sobs veterans who lack the ability grenades or enemy Medic poison injection. To them and to all who come simple concept, is intended as modifications to Fortress Forever Half-Life 2.

1637,15993,15998,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewHere are some things I had learn and play this game.  They should upgrade and fixed these thing.1# graphics: are good, need to polish some egdes on textures , weapons, armors and props. 7/102# control mechanisms: are minor good, if there were a setting that allow free control of your character's movement with out      clipping your character to go to the target this will help a lot.( example: I lock on to an enemy and activate his/her move      automatically goes to that target to do the action, instead the setting will allow free control of your character and not      allow your character to move automatically when I activate the move if I am trying to dodge incoming area attack.) The      lock on also should be fix, because when I was playing My Mage, I locking on to coggweller enemy next to crispy      skeleton enemy. I fired at the coggweller dealing amount of damage until some reason on my 7th strike of my move set      it started to attack the crispy skeleton even though it wasn't in combat with me and the coggweller was still alive at      42% health and attacking me. I was using my keybored numbers to use my actions. This need to be fix or we will pull in      unwanted enemies while in combat. 5/103# players and characters exsprestions: are not so good, but I seen worst. As much ability to sit in chairs and not the ability      to sit down on ground or any where eles this should be a thing. Make up some dance move this isn't ( MJ or      Headbanging), also is a loop and not one action move its minor cringey. Not alot of exsprestions in face. They don't      even blink and blinking is some thing you should do. The thisg thats is a problem is 2D Adventure Quest Worlds has      some blinking at least this and this  Doesn't have blinking even for Blue Flying Eye beast in Greenguard heartwood      Forest. Animation of enemies or even players should have this in there animation. Its alot of work animating walking and      fighting, but blinking why not? When you talk to a random character you are up in there faces and not once they blink.     Last thing is seeing face changing to sad, mad, scared, happy or even silly while they do action in the story or player      activating them. Its upseting story have animation while talking but can't tel if they are mad or excited for there friend      dying in the story line. this is minor exsprestion in storyline. 3/104# lack of skills: good, but still waiting. As much for skills, there aren't enough skills to unlock or even none to begin with      only classes which doesn't help if you class can't heal with a skill or have a cool move to reduce even more damage.      there is only 5 move set that is kinda sad do to  a good amount of RPG quest games online is doing, But if you can give      us abilities to unlock if we level Up. 4/105# Changing texture on weapon: good and still going up. If you have the time to Changing texture on new armor with the       same 3d mesh why not do it for the weapons, I keep seeing the color change but texture of it not changing. (exmple:       brought my self a new sword, but they texture is still the same and not seeing anything different only the color change       to dark green even my old sword was light green.) 4/10There are alot of things this game should be upgrading and fix, but only the people who played this game and people who want to make this game even better can only do it. Only supporting this game or even other games will help games to grow. Negative comments like ( THIS GAME SUCK, this game gave me aids, this game is crappy or a waist of time playing this don't play it) will not make it better.Game Developer need real comments that also can help them to make games fun. We might play games for a living or for fun, but they are working making games for us to play. They give us  free to play to try games out and if we want to upgrade our accounts we pay extra, but behind the scene help them to live and slowly upgrade the game.So is this game good? A good game is hard to tell in other people perspective if they play it. The reason why, we are all different and have different taste in games. what makes a good game is supporting the game developer and there work.for me I still play it, but still being Upgraded.

1645,7590,7594,Trove,"A nice third-person action-rpg with randomly generated world, dungeons, loot and a fully destructible and rebuildable environment. Or a sandbox buliding/crafting mmo with rpg elements and combat.  Either way if you don't mind voxelized graphics and you're a fan of a genre you're most likely going to enjoy it for some time.While I do recommend trying this game out, it has a pretty big flaw which shortens its replayability in my opinion:Trove has a huge crafting list and literally thousands of customization options for you blocks, decorations, character equipment parts etc., I'd say this game is pretty solid in terms of 'explore, mine, craft and be creative'-thing. But when it comes to combat and RPG features - it's rather lacking. While there are plently of classes and skill mechanics are polished, each class only has 3 skills(and a class passive) which are unlocked almost immediately and... that's it. There are no talents, no item-modified special effects, no skill changes of any sort. And while equipment stats are randomized, the options are pretty limited.  I like the game so far. It offers great variety but unfortunately it lacks depth.

1679,1490,1493,Fractured Space,"I've been playing this game since late alpha/early beta. I've been active in the community, lead events, and participated in competitions. Not just a paserby that didn't get interested in anything past playing on my own.I have a very serious question. Does ECG ever plan to advertise this game? To grow a player base? To reach out and seek an actual member-growing strategy? Skill brackets in PvPwere removed because the queue times to play PvP were ungodly and caused players to quit. Arguably the worst queue times most of us have ever experienced (often 45min for a game). Now, we are able to play games after probably an average of 10 minutes (those of us a little higher) which, while nice, has had huge reprocussions.Today I played aprox. 9 games where each, in a row, I was teamed with players with much lower rank than myself. For those of you wondering ""How could you know that"", I asked most, but you get to a point in this tiny community where you recognize just about every name that's near you in rank. One that I played with was apparently on his 2nd or 3rd match in PvP as a whole. Take 2 high rank players on one team... pair then with 3 incredibly low mmr players. Now pin them against 5 moderate rank players. Who will win? Experience always outweighs. But, according to the system, I should've won by a mile. Instead I lost 33mmr. Then 20mmr. Then 15mmr. Then another 20mmr (the average is 8-12 for balanced games). Game after game because ""I should win"" with green players on my side that unknowingly throw nearly every strategy. The fault isn't with these players - they're new. The fault is with this system and the development.Every update focuses on the flash of the game. Aesthetics, events, so on. When will the priority be to advertise? To fix the biggest issue the game has had since alpha? Two years is a long time. I've been here for what seems like ages; made some great friends and had a lot of laughs. But after today and after looking at the 'temporary fix' of removing brackets rather than facing the elephant-in-the-room-problem Fractured Space has had since Day 1 has made me finally decide that while this is fun to pick up occasionally and maybe play a game every week or so... it's just not worth it to try and help make a community active if the Developing team's priorities have never alligned with player base growth.Why would this be worth my energy if it's obviously not worth the devs' energy?It makes me sad. I want to love Fractured Space. But after two years of constant avoidance of the largest issue the game has ever had and no visible or obvious desire from ECG to attack it head on or even, God forbid, come up with a game plan for the future to solve it, you found a way to cover it up. No brackets. Both low and high players suffer so greatly from this. Games are only 'games' if they're fun. A blowout or a crush is neither. In fact, that's a great way to shove every player that's been playing for years away and have newcomers be completely disinterested.Don't worry, new skins are coming soon.

1697,15095,15100,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewGreat game! Lots of fun to be had playing this, build your own little ship, whether it drives, flies, hovers or simply crashes and dies, it's a huge amount of fun! A must try for those that like World of Tanks or similar. Of course being in Alpha means that it isn't clear of bugs and is not great on the server side at times, mainly when updates occur, but once it's working, and you get a good team together, it is brilliant! I'll continue to avoid doing more social things to play this instead.There is in-game purchases but you can't buy things, to my knowledge, which give you an advantage over free-to-play gamers. They're either to jump ahead in terms of tiers (so you can literally just start the game and buy a tier 7 robot), or they're to buy things like holoflags to place on your robots and show off. The system which you have to go through to progress through the game is cleverly done and keeps players at a reasonable pace when playing for free. I'm currently on Tier 8 but I have stuck in this Tier as this is where I find myself most comfortable with playing. You can quite easily jump back and fourth between Tiers so if a friend joins a week or two later you can go back and build one to play with them.Unfortunately Platoons (how you play with friends) is limited to 3 players, unless you buy premium then you get 4. Which seems small but works well to keep teams balanced in matches.Overall it is a fantastic start to a game which I believe will continue to grow as a community and continue to advance as it grows.",1, early access reviewgreat game lots fun playing build little ship drives flies hovers simply crashes dies huge fun try like world tanks similar course alpha means clear bugs great server times mainly updates occur working good team brilliant continue avoid social things play instead game purchases buy things knowledge advantage free play gamers jump ahead terms tiers literally start game buy tier robot buy things like holoflags place robots system progress game cleverly keeps players reasonable pace playing free currently tier stuck tier find comfortable playing easily jump fourth tiers friend joins week later build play unfortunately platoons play friends limited players buy premium small works teams balanced matches overall fantastic start game believe continue grow community continue advance grows

Second there are only two cars you start off with, the Aquila and the BMW. There both great I can tell you that but the Aquila has just poor steering and same goes with the BMW. Third I don't know how to earn the game currrency so that is a big problem for me. Last it said 2 hours to install and it took 7 hours and I had to wait a day for it to fully load.I would recommend this game to car and racing fans but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use has a few hard turns and you have to really judge you turning because the turn, most of the time is hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not going in a full rotation like other games. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before the cars goes from N to D or N to R. Overall I did enjoy the game but its just those few problems that took some of the joy out of playing the game.

1704,6287,6291,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewIf you are looking for a free to play world war 2 game this not for you. It is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. I am an ironsight player from other WW2 games all the way up to modern FPS games and the sights for this game are just horrendous. Map layout- The layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. Spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. Many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.Weapons- Starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. Yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. If you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). If you use a gun or GRENADE too much you have to repair it. Yes you have to repair a GRENADE!!!!!! The expense of repairing a weapon  or GRENADE is about the same price as a new gun. So if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game. Free to Play- Yes you can download it and play a few games for free. But if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. Or you can shell out money to play. I have played world of tanks, War thunder, and other WW2 FtP games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game. This is no where near a free to play game.

That's not to say that they couldn't have more card designs to make it better (more draw or cards that help fix mana in some way) but designers have to take into account positives and negatives when balancing, not just dwell on salient negative outcomes which are often self inflicted e.g. through bad deck building.",1, early access reviewbasically mtg streamlined playable computer mobile unique mechanics set apart like mtg mana screw flood thing think people complaining claims borne statistics discounting positive aspects type guaranteed mana system like making possible powerful cards high end card designs better draw cards help fix mana way designers account positives negatives balancing dwell salient negative outcomes self inflicted bad deck building

1718,13579,13583,Creativerse,"This game looked interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I play single player and after a couple of hours this game became tedious and boring.  I have a logical mind and one of my first issues with the game is that the crafting recipes are dumb.  Some of the recipes have redundant materials like needing bedrock and stone slabs(made from bedrock or other stone types) which are the same material. An example of this is the obsidian mining cell.  Some of the recipes have requirements that don't even make sense like needing mushrooms and/or flowers for a component type item.  The obsidian mining cell is an example of this as well.  This redundant and unnecessary material requirement affects a lot of the recipes that I have unlocked at this point.  The point seems to be to force exploration.  If you want me to explore, give me something worth finding not dumb recipe requirements.Another issue is that you waste resources because you must craft an item to unlock the next recipe.  An example of this is I wanted stone windows for my building so I had to craft wood windows first to unlock the stone window recipe.  Now I have a set of wood windows that I will not use and those resources are wasted.I'm not impressed with the combat mechanics of the game either.  All of the creatures I fought so far have a wide area attack and you must be very close to even get a hit.  The weapons do little damage and on multiple occasions I ended up running for my life.  Your default weapon is stick.  No joke, it's a stick and it's worthless.  The first upgrade is a wooden sword and it's not much better.The storage units are inadequate in the game due to all of the resources you must collect.  Each storage upgrade from the basic wood chest that I unlocked only had about 8 more slots each.  Not really worth the upgrades.The game also pushes paid content.  If you want to fly, you must upgrade to Pro.  If you want the nice building blocks, you must buy the DLC.  The developer seems to be trying to make a lot of money very quickly.To me, the game seems to be targeted at children due to its comic style creatures and feel.  In summary, If you're willing to pay for Pro, the multiplayer may be fun, but the content is just too limited for single player and as previously stated gets tedious and boring very quickly.  To a logical mind, the recipe system just doesn't make sense. On a positive note, the graphics are nice.  This is the only feature that I feel is better than Minecraft (no contest).If you have a logical mind like myself, I don't recommend this game.  Other mindsets may find it likeable.",0, game looked interesting decided try play single player couple hours game tedious boring logical mind issues game crafting recipes dumb recipes redundant materials like needing bedrock stone bedrock stone types material example obsidian mining cell recipes requirements sense like needing mushrooms flowers component type item obsidian mining cell example redundant unnecessary material requirement affects lot recipes unlocked point point force exploration want explore worth finding dumb recipe requirements issue waste resources craft item unlock recipe example wanted stone windows building craft wood windows unlock stone window recipe set wood windows use resources wasted impressed combat mechanics game creatures fought far wide area attack close hit weapons little damage multiple occasions ended running life default weapon stick joke stick worthless upgrade wooden sword better storage units inadequate game resources collect storage upgrade basic wood chest unlocked slots worth upgrades game pushes paid content want fly upgrade pro want nice building blocks buy dlc developer trying lot money quickly game targeted children comic style creatures feel summary willing pay pro multiplayer fun content limited single player previously stated gets tedious boring quickly logical mind recipe system sense positive note graphics nice feature feel better minecraft logical mind like recommend game mindsets find likeable

1739,4236,4240,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"The Six Steps of CheesemakingAcidification: Starter culture is added to milk to change lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. This process changes the acidity level of the milk and begins the process of turning milk from a liquid into a solid.Coagulation: Rennet is added to further encourage the milk to solidify.Curds and Whey: Curds are cut using a knife or a tool that resembles a rake. Cutting the curds further encourages them to expel liquid or whey. Generally, the smaller the curds are cut, the harder the resulting cheese will be. Soft cheeses like Camembert or Brie are hardly cut at all. Harder cheeses like Cheddar and Gruyere are cut into a very fine texture. For these harder cheeses, the curds are further manipulated by cheddaring and/or cooking. Cooking the curd changes its texture, making it tender rather than crumbly.Salting: Salt adds flavor and also acts as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil during long months or years of aging also helps a natural rind to form on the cheese. There are several ways to use salt. Salt can be added directly into the curd as the cheese is being made. The outside of the wheel of cheese can be rubbed with salt or with a damp cloth that has been soaked in brine. The cheese can also be bathed directly in vat of brine.Shaping: The cheese is put into a basket or a mold to form it into a specific shape. During this process, the cheese is also pressed with weights or a machine to expel any remaining liquid.Ripening: Referred to as affinage, this process ages cheese until it reaches optimal ripeness. During this process, the temperature and humidity of the cave or room where the cheese ages is closely monitored. An experienced affineur knows how to properly treat each cheese so it develops the proper flavor and texture. For some cheeses, ambient molds in the air give the cheese a distinct flavor. For others, mold is introduced by spraying it on the cheese (brie) or injecting it into the cheese (blue cheese). Some cheeses must be turned, some must be brushed with oil, and some must be washed with brine or alcohol.",1, steps cheesemakingacidification starter culture added milk change lactose milk sugar lactic acid process changes acidity level milk begins process turning milk liquid solid coagulation rennet added encourage milk solidify curds whey curds cut knife tool resembles rake cutting curds encourages expel liquid whey generally smaller curds cut harder resulting cheese soft cheeses like camembert brie hardly cut harder cheeses like cheddar gruyere cut fine texture harder cheeses curds manipulated cheddaring cooking cooking curd changes texture making tender crumbly salting salt adds flavor acts preservative cheese spoil long months years aging helps natural rind form cheese ways use salt salt added directly curd cheese outside wheel cheese rubbed salt damp cloth soaked brine cheese bathed directly vat brine shaping cheese basket mold form specific shape process cheese pressed weights machine expel remaining liquid ripening referred affinage process ages cheese reaches optimal ripeness process temperature humidity cave room cheese ages closely monitored experienced affineur knows properly treat cheese develops proper flavor texture cheeses ambient molds air cheese distinct flavor mold introduced spraying cheese brie injecting cheese blue cheese cheeses turned brushed oil washed brine alcohol

1745,8198,8202,Neverwinter,"A F2P game with some elements of nickle and diming but they're avoidable. It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.     Resetting your character's active skills costs ""Zen"" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called ""Feats"" cost ingame currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.    Unfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the ""Looking For Group"" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.     All in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD.

I know it's a bit cliché to compare it to Hearthstone but the mechanics are very close, so I think it's only fair to make some comparisons. Very close to Hearthstone in terms of gameplay which can be a good & a bad thing.

Prophecy cards can also be played for free when runes break.- Two lanes, each with their own playstyle, which makes for interesting strategic choices.- Cards can level up (not during gameplay, I mean permanently upgrade). It feels more fair and less RNJ than Hearthsone but still not as fair as Magic or Gwent. Generous when it comes to giving packs and resources to craft cards.

1769,14816,14821,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, I would like to say it has been absolute ages since I have played this game. And when I used to play the most (during 2014). I only managed to get a couple of months of playtime before the first bad update, that had made people start leaving. That was the update that got rid of tiers. I only came back to check up on it and see if it had improved any, and hoooooooooooooo boy, that was the worst mistake I have ever made in my entire life.First thing is first, this ""game"" looks nothing at all like it used to. To even say that this is the same game as the Robocraft people used to play is an absoulute insult. The current ""Robocraft"", is so different from the way it used to be, it might as well be an entirely different game altogether. And truth be told, the way it currently plays, it practically is! With the lootboxes, and market, and just the way the game plays with all these new weapons, nothing is the same as how it used to be. That is for the game that is.Now I don't know if any of the older players have checked out the official robocraft website recently, but there is one big change that gives off a huge red flag. The ability to comment on any of their posts is no longer available. Why is this? I honestly have no idea. But if anything, it speaks loud and clear, that the devs want nothing to do with interacting with the fanbase. If they even have one anymore, that is.They have started putting polls on their website though. These polls are supposed to let them know what the fanbase wants the most. But of course, with it being a poll the options are limited as to what you can pick. However there is usually a little part at the end that lets you write any improvements that may not have been listed. All I can say is that if we realy want the true Robocraft back, to use this section of the poll to the fullest extent. Especially since they do not seem to be listening to the people writing reviews about their game. I have already taken said poll myself, and have written about some things that may need improvement.In the end though, all I can realy say to freejam, is that you seem to have forgotten why you won the Indie 2014 awards. You won it because the fans voted for your game (myself included), becaue it was really well made! To say that you deserve such an award now would be an absoulute lie, because a large number of your fans have not supported your current desicions and have been leaving. And that is the only reason, you even got that award in the first place. Because people loved you. Now however......",0, early access reviewfirst like absolute ages played game play managed couple months playtime bad update people start leaving update got rid tiers came check improved hoooooooooooooo boy worst mistake entire life thing game looks like game robocraft people play absoulute insult current robocraft different way entirely different game altogether truth told way currently plays practically lootboxes market way game plays new weapons game know older players checked official robocraft website recently big change gives huge red flag ability comment posts longer available honestly idea speaks loud clear devs want interacting fanbase anymore started putting polls website polls supposed let know fanbase wants course poll options limited pick usually little end lets write improvements listed realy want true robocraft use section poll fullest extent especially listening people writing reviews game taken said poll written things need improvement end realy freejam forgotten won indie awards won fans voted game included becaue deserve award absoulute lie large number fans supported current desicions leaving reason got award place people loved

That's up to you.You know by now that there will be several bummers, so here we go. This is not for little children who thrown themselves on the floor when something does not go their way.As of now you will need to run two different versions of the game (actually three if you also want to run Steam) an alpha and a beta, and although a unified version has been announced for early 2016 we now almost have 2018 and we still have no firm release date.

1782,4944,4948,Brawlhalla,"is the story of how a simple 2D fighting game gave me anger issues.for my opinion this game sucks legit its grind after grind the comunity sucks and there are a lot of spamers they dont buff or nerf the wepons which suck  cuz facking axe and scythe are the most op weapons in this game they are 2 rule if you want to enjoy this pice of trash 1: dont play ranked if you want to destroy your controler or your monitor or if you want play 2v2 ranked 2: play with your frends dont play solo cuz sucks every time  My conclusion:         The game works pretty well in theory. It's quite similar to Super Smash Bros, which is a game that many people enjoy, myself included. You pick a character with a simple weaponset consisting of two weapons. The weapons include spears, katars, scythes, swords, gauntlets, blasters, axes, bows, hammers, and cannons and now a orb  My personal main, Orion, utilizes rocket lance and spear.After choosing your character, you'll enter the game. You'll notice that the characters have both light attacks and heavy attacks, or signature attacks, which you can use in chain combos. Each character has original signature moves; no two legends are the same.With the basics out of the way, you'll probably find yourself having some fun in a simple matchmaking or bot game. You'll play a few rounds, get a grip on what you're doing, and log off for a while, having enjoyed some harmless fun on an innocent looking game.The game has a great art style and a great soundtrack, I'll give it that. You can tell the developers made an attempt to make a game that could be enjoyed by everybody.Well, try not to let these first impressions impact you to hard. Past the surface, this game and its community are on a whole new level of toxicity, chaos, and general despair. In fact, I'd even compare Brawlhalla to a drug. On the surface and on light occasions, Brawlhalla is general, good fun, especially with friends. However, if you start liking it a little too much, or if you want to get better, the trouble begins. Now, where to start?First of all, the game can be incredibly frustrating. Gaming rage is inevitable in pretty much every game. It might even be healthy to let off a little steam. This game, however? Brawlhalla has given me some of the worst gaming rage I've ever had.Hey, difficult games are perfectly acceptable. There are countless examples of games where deaths feel fair and deserved and make you want to persevere through them to the end, making the reward even more satisfying. It's intoxicating in the best way. It makes you feel great!In Brawlhalla, however, almost every death is completely unfair. Even now, I still play matches where I'm left shaking my head in disbelief at some of the brutality that comes rolling my way. It makes me want to play more, not because I feel good about what I'm doing but because I feel like I need to prove myself or get better to try and get past whatever stupidly unjust attack I'm hit with to no avail. It's a brutal endless cycle that keeps pulling you back for more.The spamming problem in Brawlhalla is a major one, but it really is a simple fix. Add cooldown times to attacks after using them three times or so in a row to encourage players to experiment with more attacks and combos. This would not only fix the spam problem, it would build skill and better tactics for the next battle.As a usually pretty sensible guy, I never thought that one game would have such a negative impact on my life. I beg of you, if you want to keep your family, friends, free time, and anything else dear to you, avoid this game at all costs.thats all i have to say i dont want to play this game anymore  only small exception with frends",0, story simple fighting game gave anger opinion game sucks legit grind grind comunity sucks lot spamers nt buff nerf wepons suck cuz facking axe scythe op weapons game rule want enjoy pice trash nt play ranked want destroy controler monitor want play ranked play frends nt play solo cuz sucks time conclusion game works pretty theory similar super smash bros game people enjoy included pick character simple weaponset consisting weapons weapons include spears katars scythes swords gauntlets blasters axes bows hammers cannons orb personal main orion utilizes rocket lance spear choosing character enter game notice characters light attacks heavy attacks signature attacks use chain combos character original signature moves legends basics way probably find having fun simple matchmaking bot game play rounds grip log having enjoyed harmless fun innocent looking game game great art style great soundtrack tell developers attempt game enjoyed everybody try let impressions impact hard past surface game community new level toxicity chaos general despair fact compare brawlhalla drug surface light occasions brawlhalla general good fun especially friends start liking little want better trouble begins game incredibly frustrating gaming rage inevitable pretty game healthy let little steam game brawlhalla given worst gaming rage hey difficult games perfectly acceptable countless examples games deaths feel fair deserved want persevere end making reward satisfying intoxicating best way makes feel brawlhalla death completely unfair play matches left shaking head disbelief brutality comes rolling way makes want play feel good feel like need prove better try past stupidly unjust attack hit avail brutal endless cycle keeps pulling spamming problem brawlhalla major simple fix add cooldown times attacks times row encourage players experiment attacks combos fix spam problem build skill better tactics battle usually pretty sensible guy thought game negative impact life beg want family friends free time dear avoid game nt want play game anymore small exception frends

They finally go to reverting the forge patch which is great I love my sniper rifle and the most fun I have in this game is just rushing my Sniper and outplaying people it's very rewarding when you master a class and outplay other people or land NASTY headshots. As of the current patch Slug, Crossbow are so busted and just annoying to fight against specially when you land in a hotted zone and end up with a garbage shotgun/poison pistol vs someone with slug or crossbow. They should be fixing those weapons and fixing the hitboxes which are to big. Over-all the game is still fun and rewarding, but also very frustrating at times one thing will never change about any BR is you might fight someone equally skilled or geared and close fight only to kill the last player in all greens.... something needs to happen about the campers it's just Pathetic!

1786,15831,15836,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewA Developer from Artix Entertainment had requested reviews from players after only being in OPEN BETA for one hour which is a bit of a joke but I have enough to make a review so here it is.Quick Review for those with more time on your hands.Is it worth playing: Not really there are better games out there for free Unless you intend to play on tablet or androidHow would you rate it out of 10? : A solid 4 Its a game equivilant of Meh Would I recommend to others : Nope Id suggest playing Adventure Quest Worlds instead is it a lot better constructed considering it is a sider scrolling web based game.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first and biggest issue is the fact that this game was originally aimed at PC players of AQWorlds as the next AQ game and yet they spent so much time making the controls work for mobile/tablet users that they have forgotten how make it interesting for PC players. Character Customization : It is pretty standard and not a lot of variations even with the added barber shop into the game so not alot to talk about there.The Pathing and quest system are a joke because as of right now after you finish the tutorial you and just smack bang in this town that you are expected to know the layout and locations of everything with just random NPCs offering you quests for NPCs that you cannot find by a tracker or even in the quest information. So you are literally screwed from the word *Go* and If you have no prior experience of the game YOU ARE SCREWED.Now onto Monsters : At the moment of writing this it is in Open beta so its to be expected that things need to be worked out, But currently I was dealing 1/5th of the damage I was being dealt by monsters of the same level as myself and for the sake of arguements I was a fully geared warrior  So it makes zero sense that I should be getting destroyed by one monster as the same level as me.Combat system: This is where I believe that Artix Entertainment has done quite well for themselves because the actual animations of the attacks are quite good so in that regards I commend them But due to the long drawn out animations it would seem that where I as the player would get one special move off the opposing monster/s will be able to get 2 or even 3 attacks off therefore rendering my damage pointless because they have caught up to my damage spike and even done some more which inturn requires me to demolish my supplies of potions that I have/had.UI/Menu : Again I honestly think Artix Entertainment has really done well on the UI and Menu system, For a phone or tablet game, There is no need to restrict PC users to such a simplistic and just empty screen and weirdly enough they have locked the chatbox to the topleft of the screen even though ther is nothing else on the bottom left, Which is another indication that they only thought about phone and tablet users.Sounds and Music : I think the Music is alright not the best but what the hell its better than nothing am i right ? but when looting or attacking it suddenly gets extremely loud and every time you loot a monster it is preset to make the sound of a chest opening when your opening a bag, Now thats just lazy because it doesnt take a lot of time to make 2 different sounds for different containers of items that monsters will drop. The attacking noises are extremely loud for really no reason in really random areas, Such as making that trademark *Sheen* Noise when it is swung but it is so loud if you really want to listen to it Id Highly recommend making the sound very low.",0, early access reviewa developer artix entertainment requested reviews players open beta hour bit joke review quick review time hands worth playing better games free intend play tablet androidhow rate solid game equivilant meh recommend nope d suggest playing adventure quest worlds instead lot better constructed considering sider scrolling web based biggest issue fact game originally aimed pc players aqworlds aq game spent time making controls work mobile tablet users forgotten interesting pc players character customization pretty standard lot variations added barber shop game alot talk pathing quest system joke right finish tutorial smack bang town expected know layout locations random npcs offering quests npcs find tracker quest information literally screwed word prior experience game monsters moment writing open beta expected things need worked currently dealing damage dealt monsters level sake arguements fully geared warrior makes zero sense getting destroyed monster level combat system believe artix entertainment actual animations attacks good regards commend long drawn animations player special opposing monster s able attacks rendering damage pointless caught damage spike inturn requires demolish supplies potions ui menu honestly think artix entertainment ui menu system phone tablet game need restrict pc users simplistic screen weirdly locked chatbox topleft screen ther left indication thought phone tablet users sounds music think music alright best hell better right looting attacking suddenly gets extremely loud time loot monster preset sound chest opening opening bag s lazy nt lot time different sounds different containers items monsters drop attacking noises extremely loud reason random areas making trademark sheen noise swung loud want listen d highly recommend making sound low

That and there used to be different tiers of robots, this would keep things balanced so people wouldn't put the strongest weapons on unless they wanted to be matched with similar strength robots. Removal of this feature means players like me with all of 20 hours in the game that have mid grade weapons get matched with people with 1000 hours in the game who have some of the highest grade weapons.

1825,3036,3039,War Thunder,"So let me start this off that I absolutely love this game but it has a lot of issues with it.I will explain the pros and cons and features the game currently needs below.I have been playing the game since 2013 and my hours are not correct as I have a pre-steam version of the game and only recently switched to a steam version.PROS:-The tank combat is outstanding and imo it is far superior then World of tanks in many ways.-The selection of tanks and airplanes is vast and they are constantly adding new ones into the game(currently adding French airplane line.)-Arcade Air combat is a lot of fun as it lifts most of the restraints that you wouldnt experience in realistic or simulator.You can make turns that would normally rip your wings off.-The maps and all the vehicles are absolutely stunning at max settings and I have no issue running it on either of my pcs, one has a single gtx 980 and my main pc has 3 980ti.-Gaijin is constantly updating the game and patching issues that are reported and doing rebalances of gameplay.-There is multiple game modes to choose from ranging from Arcade to simulator and even have events/tournaments.CONS:- Though the tanks/airplanes are fairly historical looking the actual function of the vehicles is not. German BF109s and FW(focke-Wolf) are absolutely nerfed beyond belief. In realistic they do not turn whatso ever and are just shredded 90% of the time by every nation. Now granted if you use stick and paddles you will be able to maneuver alot better and beat most with mouse and keyboard but if you run into someone else using same thing you stand no chance normally.  The german tanks are known for their power at the time and that does/doesnt show in the game. Many of the tanks that Germany used were powerful and heavily armoured but in War thunder it seems there is a bias by the developers about them. German tanks were very slow compared to most tanks yes but they were hard to kill from the front and even from the sides on some of them but in War thunder I have seen Tiger I destroyed in single shots through the front by light tanks. There is also a huge issue with the fact that a panther and Tiger are unable to penetrate the sloped front of the Sherman which was only 2 inches thick and with angle only made it 3.6 inches thick. Yes the armor was good to stop a panzer 3 but it could easily be penetrated by Tiger I and Panther.-Huge Russian biased for all of their vehicles!!!! The tanks seem to have twice the armour that is actually listed and bounce so many shots its unbelievable. I had a russian game where I bounce 13 shots in a row from 4 different tanks at different angles and was able to take all 4 of them out without taking any major damage. The Russian Air force was vastly out matched by the Luftwaffe for nearly the entire war but in War thunder once again Russian airplanes crush every other nations airplanes with ease. -People are able to turn the game settings to the lowest possible graphics that it gives them an advantage over those who play are higher details.At the lowest setting it removes bushes at longer distances and decreases the foliage on trees and even removes some boulders/rocks on the map. This allows people to shoot from farther distances and be hidden to those playing at a higher detail and is a very cheap tactic that is being taken advantage of for years now. Only recently has it become so bad that atleast 75% of the time you will be shot from across the map without seeing the enemy. I have even watched replays on maps were people are shooting through the ground and hitting people at the bottom of a hill.-The game has two different currencies being Silver Lions and Golden Eagles. Silver Lions are earn through getting kills,hits, capturing zones etc. while Golden Eagles are bought with real money. Now yes the game is a free game and has to have some way of earning income the way it is in place in War Thunder is fine 90% of the time until you figure out that it gives some nations an unfair advantage and screws over others. A good example is the Russians get a IS-6 in tier 4, to those who dont know there is 6 tier. Now you might think that isnt a big issue but it is when you look at the tanks it is facing which are far inferior to an IS-6. What makes it worse is the fact that the IS-3 is a tier 5 tank. Now historically the is-6 did was not better then a IS-2 or IS-3 and very few IS-6 were made because of this but once again Russian bias makes this tank over powered. Another good example is the only German tier 4 tank is the Ru-251 can only be bought with Golden eagles meaning Germany does not have a tier 4 light tank to use putting it at a huge disadvantage.-Another huge issue is uptiering, Everytime I play as a German in tier 3 with battle rating 5.7 in realistic I am instantly uptiered to battle rating 6.7. Going up in a tier makes a huge difference as you will go from fighting is-1s and t34-85s to is-6 is-2 etc which is hard for a tiger to take out due to the bias against German vehicles.There is so much more I could go into about Cons that I am just going to end it where I am at just because I feel the Cons alone are enough of a sign that the game is broken due to a Bias against German vehicles and the fact that Russian vehicles seem to be the greatest thing ever made. This game brough me alot of fun when I first started playing it but now days I get so angry due to being killed by people using low detail to have cheap kills or running into russian super vehicles. If you do decide to get into the game I suggest if you are going to play tanks to play simulator as it so far its the only game mode anymore worth playing imo.",0, let start absolutely love game lot issues explain pros cons features game currently needs playing game hours correct pre steam version game recently switched steam version tank combat outstanding imo far superior world tanks selection tanks airplanes vast constantly adding new ones adding french airplane air combat lot fun lifts restraints nt experience realistic simulator turns normally rip wings maps vehicles absolutely stunning max settings issue running pcs single gtx main pc constantly updating game patching issues reported rebalances multiple game modes choose ranging arcade simulator events tournaments tanks airplanes fairly historical looking actual function vehicles german wolf absolutely nerfed belief realistic turn whatso shredded time nation granted use stick paddles able maneuver alot better beat mouse keyboard run thing stand chance normally german tanks known power time doesnt game tanks germany powerful heavily armoured war thunder bias developers german tanks slow compared tanks yes hard kill sides war thunder seen tiger destroyed single shots light tanks huge issue fact panther tiger unable penetrate sloped sherman inches thick angle inches thick yes armor good stop panzer easily penetrated tiger russian biased vehicles tanks twice armour actually listed bounce shots unbelievable russian game bounce shots row different tanks different angles able taking major damage russian air force vastly matched luftwaffe nearly entire war war thunder russian airplanes crush nations airplanes ease able turn game settings lowest possible graphics gives advantage play higher details lowest setting removes bushes longer distances decreases foliage trees removes boulders rocks map allows people shoot farther distances hidden playing higher detail cheap tactic taken advantage years recently bad atleast time shot map seeing enemy watched replays maps people shooting ground hitting people game different currencies silver lions golden eagles silver lions earn getting kills hits capturing zones etc golden eagles bought real money yes game free game way earning income way place war thunder fine time figure gives nations unfair advantage screws good example russians tier nt know tier think nt big issue look tanks facing far inferior makes worse fact tier tank historically better russian bias makes tank powered good example german tier tank bought golden eagles meaning germany tier light tank use putting huge huge issue uptiering everytime play german tier battle rating realistic instantly uptiered battle rating going tier makes huge difference fighting etc hard tiger bias german vehicles cons going end feel cons sign game broken bias german vehicles fact russian vehicles greatest thing game brough alot fun started playing days angry killed people low detail cheap kills running russian super vehicles decide game suggest going play tanks play simulator far game mode anymore worth playing imo

1829,7941,7945,Neverwinter,"I really like this game. I almost didn't bother with it after seeing such bad reviews. I realize that this is a free to play MMORPG. Something a company thought of to give the public something to do with their time. These reviews sadden me because I feel like the people who wrote them were being truly ungrateful. Some things you do need to buy but they give a lot of different items so you don't have to pay. You get a horse for crying out loud for 5 gold and a variety of companions for 2. Some games that's completely impossible. You can get astral diamonds from the online gateway and you get nearly 10,000 a day for repeatable quest, PLUS you can sell any rare items to accumulate more astral. You can even get rare pets from events pretty easily. I recently got a flame sprite, and it's awesome,  if you don't have 300,000+ in a month then it's probably not the games fault. It's probably yours because everyone has a life but the game gives you what you need to be successful. I haven't gotten to the higher levels yet BUT so far I've leveled up VERY easily with no problems. Runestones are dropped left and right from any dungeon. I love the dungeons, I love how it's practically got a video game type interface. Don't let the reviews make you turn away from this game. Check it out yourself. If you like it fine, if you don't, that's fine too, but don't leave a nasty review making other people turn away because YOU can't get something you might want. I recently got a 3ds and I am thankful. I am not going to complain about how I have very limited games or about the color. Going to be grateful the damn thing was free. Not all games are for everyone but that doesn't mean it deserves such negativity that half of these reviews displayed.",1, like game bother seeing bad reviews realize free play mmorpg company thought public time reviews sadden feel like people wrote truly ungrateful things need buy lot different items pay horse crying loud gold variety companions games completely impossible astral diamonds online gateway nearly day repeatable quest plus sell rare items accumulate astral rare pets events pretty easily recently got flame sprite awesome month probably games fault probably life game gives need successful gotten higher levels far leveled easily problems runestones dropped left right dungeon love dungeons love practically got video game type interface let reviews turn away game check like fine fine leave nasty review making people turn away want recently got thankful going complain limited games color going grateful damn thing free games mean deserves negativity half reviews displayed

1844,13803,13807,Dreadnought,"I've been playing this in Beta for about a year now. I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I've experienced it in a better state than it is in Steam at the moment and I believe the devs, if given a chance, can get it back to that state. Let me elaborate with areas needing improvement and some serious positives about this game. Areas Needing Improvement:- Menu (non-gameplay) UI: Went from passable in Beta to absolutely atrocious with the Steam release; This needs to be addressed ASAP by devs as it is hindering many new players from falling in love with the game- Sounds design: I really don't know why they had to touch the audio as it was fine as it was in Beta. Audio ques in this Steam release has been degraded. On a positive note, the devs know this and are working hard to fix it (I hope... soon...)- In game social: The player communications interface is glitchy and often down-right broken. This was an issue in Beta and remains an issue now. - Devs and Feedback: This might be the biggest issue. The team at SixFoot seems to have problems incorporating PLAYER feedback into their releases and patches. There is a lively and respectful player community that has offered many suggestions for improving the game only to be let down when SixFoot goes the complete opposite direction. This is a matter of changing the culture there... so management, take heed if you want to save yourself from the brink. Positives: - Core gameplay and balance is well done- Each ship class requires it's own tactics and team play strategy is key- Customization through modules and officer briefings add additional depth to what initially seems like a simple game mechanic- Player-base since Steam release has improved thus more matches and shorter waiting times- Graphics (gameplay) are pretty good with little details ",1, playing beta year giving game thumbs experienced better state steam moment believe devs given chance state let elaborate areas needing improvement positives game areas needing menu non gameplay ui went passable beta absolutely atrocious steam release needs addressed asap devs hindering new players falling love sounds design know touch audio fine beta audio ques steam release degraded positive note devs know working hard fix hope soon game social player communications interface glitchy right broken issue beta remains issue devs feedback biggest issue team sixfoot problems incorporating player feedback releases patches lively respectful player community offered suggestions improving game let sixfoot goes complete opposite direction matter changing culture management heed want save brink positives core gameplay balance ship class requires tactics team play strategy customization modules officer briefings add additional depth initially like simple game player base steam release improved matches shorter waiting graphics gameplay pretty good little details

1847,6196,6200,Heroes & Generals,"Part I: TanksIf I was asked to put it in one word, I'd say: Frustrating.Second word would be: Dissapointing.Third: Hopeless.Frustrating because there are so many flaws, broken mechanics, plain stupid game design decisions that you will get tons of negative emotions out of this ""game"". Lets name a few (not evey by all means, there are too many): 1. Physics. They are bearable, but primitive leaving you with an impression of a very cheap or old game. Tank wont pass through wire or can be stopped with a car parked on his path. We are talking about a moving tank btw.2. Balance. There is none. 2 to 4 tiers of tanks in each category: lights, mediums, heavies and TDs. Balancer does not take tiers into account meaning you will fight T-70 in your Pz Ia (you can't pen their armor) or Chaffies in your T-38 (they will kill you in 3 seconds. Not a pleasant experience, And it will take you few months to grind to Panther or T34-85. And keep in mind that intermediate tiers are not worth buying, so if you are a fan of grinding and suffering this game is for you and that review is not.3. Stupid game design decisions. Reto managed to create a situation where tanks are both frustrating to play for and against. As an infantry its not fun to be killed over and over again by HEs with 20 m splash from another half of the map. Mind that tanks have like 3 sec reload (some) so these splashes will hit often. On the other hand it takes just 2 magnetic grenades to kill a tank and there is no way to see them coming as tanks have limited vision. So you have to rely on your teammates. Random teammates. Good luck with that. Or you can bring friend who will waist his time guarding your tank. You know what will be a reaction of a Kings Tiger driver when he hears an infantry whistle somewhere near? RUN, RUN for your life! Like a terrified dear through the woods. Yeah! Thats what these so called developers (a community laughing stock) managed to create.Dissapointing as the concept is good.

1856,10938,10942,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewEdit: one minor gripe. As you keep playing, even once you max out Gauntlet and Forge, the enemies keep getting harder. This normally would be an okay thing, but it eventually becomes impossible. While the game is very rewarding, it doesn't reward you enough to keep up with the increasing difficulty, and increasing legendary cards your AI opponents will play on you. Eventually you're reduced to playing Gauntlets and hoping for them to get crap hands the entire match, or else risk being reduced to getting Wooden Chests for your efforts. This REALLY forces you into a wall. And even buying packs won't help, because they seldom ever give you any cards that boost your ability. A legendary drop from a card pack is an extremely rare thing. This makes it feel like you're reduced to waiting for seasons to reset, so you can start beating opponents for rewards again. Been playing it on mobile more than Steam. So my time is low on here. I highly recommend to MTG and Hearthstone fans that are looking for something a bit more rewarding. This game really doesn't reach for your wallet at all. And it's very friendly towards people that just want to play Solo against AI. It doesn't force you to play other people to earn currency/packs like Hearthstone does. I do wish you could clear out the daily quests from the forced mutliplayer stuff, however. The mechanics are closer to MTG than Hearthstone. But the attributes of cards (charge, deadly, etc) follow more closely to Hearthstone than MTG.It has a good sized campaign, which mostly sits as your tutorial. There's a Gauntlet mode, reminscent of HS's Arena mode, though you'll pick your deck before hand. There's a Forge mode that's exactly like Arena from HS, picking between 3 cards up until your deck is finished, then battling a series of opponents.  I've really only checked the Solo side of things. I know MP has Ranked and Casual, and a Draft. I've heard rumblings that some decks are unbalanced in MP (aggro decks that kill before you can even get your mana up). But I can't really speak on that. I guess I can see where you can make some insane OP decks. But that's kind of the fun part. I've been doing the same, and ranking up in Gauntlet. This game throws free packs, and currency at you like i've never seen in a FTP game before. It's very generous. You will get plenty of cards for your collection if you play regularly.EDIT: Still really enjoying this game a few days later. which is unusual for me. I usually binge on a game, and then am done with it after a few days. This game is just so rewarding. I'm playing Gauntlets, Forges, and Drafts, and the game just throws gold, crafting shards, and packs at you like crazy. The satisfaction of building a successful deck, and trying new strategies really keeps this game going for me. Comparing decks on websites like EternalWarcry, and planning my next deck is a big plus too. Again, I really have a high recommendation for this game.Update - July 16,2018: One minor gripe. When the game absolutely wants you to lose, you're going to lose. You'll either draw no mana, or all mana and no minions/powers. Or the opposing AI will topdeck a perfect game on you. It just happens sometimes. So be prepared for that. I really wish they'd adjust the AI/RNG for that. It's PAINFULLY obvious when you're getting blocked from a win on a Forge/Gauntlet or otherwise AI match. You can tell when there's a fair exchange after playing a few weeks. And then you can tell when the game just absolutely doesn't want you to win.",1, early access reviewedit minor gripe playing max gauntlet forge enemies getting harder normally okay thing eventually impossible game rewarding reward increasing difficulty increasing legendary cards ai opponents play eventually reduced playing gauntlets hoping crap hands entire match risk reduced getting wooden chests efforts forces wall buying packs wo help seldom cards boost ability legendary drop card pack extremely rare thing makes feel like reduced waiting seasons reset start beating opponents rewards playing mobile steam time low highly recommend mtg hearthstone fans looking bit rewarding game reach wallet friendly people want play solo ai force play people earn currency packs like hearthstone wish clear daily quests forced mutliplayer stuff mechanics closer mtg hearthstone attributes cards charge deadly etc follow closely hearthstone good sized campaign sits tutorial gauntlet mode reminscent hs arena mode pick deck hand forge mode exactly like arena hs picking cards deck finished battling series opponents checked solo things know mp ranked casual draft heard rumblings decks unbalanced mp aggro decks kill mana speak guess insane op decks kind fun ranking gauntlet game throws free packs currency like seen ftp game generous plenty cards collection play regularly edit enjoying game days later unusual usually binge game days game rewarding playing gauntlets forges drafts game throws gold crafting shards packs like crazy satisfaction building successful deck trying new strategies keeps game going comparing decks websites like eternalwarcry planning deck big plus high recommendation game update july minor gripe game absolutely wants lose going lose draw mana mana minions powers opposing ai topdeck perfect game happens prepared wish adjust ai rng painfully obvious getting blocked win forge gauntlet ai match tell fair exchange playing weeks tell game absolutely want win

1861,10984,10988,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewGood concept for a Card Game, but at the moment it doesn't work well because of power cards. Maybe they correct it in the future by adding some more ways to search and add power from your deck (like MTG does) and by removing the ""you need to have 1/3 of your deck as power cards"".I will update this review in the future when they send more patchs...***Cons***1#-> Every game is like getting tons of power cards or getting none. I lost the count of how many times I played 5 or more straight turns getting power cards or getting 1 or 2 in more than 10 turns... Because of this kind of thing you don't need to be a skilled player you just need to have a set of hat made of Four-leaf clovers and a rabbit's foot necklace.2#-> You have 90% trash cards and only 10% good cards that cost a huge amount of stones. It's absurd how crafting cost pass from 50 and 100 to 800 and 1600 stones... Maybe they could balance cards and by doing that reduce the crafting cost, would be better for the game itself because this would open more deck possibilities.3#-> ""You need to have 1/3 of your deck as power cards"", this limitation helps the 1# to get bigger.4#-> Because of the first three major cons, your deck options are reduced by control, aggro and midrange deck types (see tournament decks for more info), burn, earlygame and other types of decks are very cool and fun to play with, but your win rate will probably be lower than the 3 types I mentioned before because of 1#.5#-> They should implement some kind of matchmaking system for casual, I observed that basically the actual system is only.... Oh I found a player for you... there is no level or win / lose rate to balance this kind of thing, new players get destroyed by old players this way.6#-> Small problem, they created the new mode Puzzles, it's a very good mode but I feel that the rewards for this are very low comparing the other ones. Maybe they could add chests or more gold to it.***Pros***1#-> The campaign is pretty good, you can learn fast how the game works and how to make some basic decks.2#-> The other AI modes are very good too (Puzzles, Gauntlet, Forge). In puzzles you will have a good experience on how the card habilities should be used and you will need some smart moves to finish it. Gauntlet is kind of a mortal kombat tower, you will have to defeat all enemies to fight against one big boss with a hability that benefits his deck, but sometimes it can help you out too. Forge is like Gauntlet, but you will get a random pack of cards and you will have to create a deck from it and use it until the end (this mode you need to spend some gold or real money to play).3#-> Casual Ranked and Draft are cool to play too, but for casual they should 5#.4#-> Animations and game design are great in my opinion, they didn't put a lot of effects in cards so you can play this game in many devices (pcs,laptops,tablets...), you don't need to have a good pc to play it. The only thing I think they should do is to improve the interaction player and field as Blizzard did in Heartstone (in this game you only interact with the totems).5#-> F2P with amazing rewards. You don't need to spend tons of money to get good cards, you can farm them by playing the game (will take a huge amount of time, but still not a P2W game).6#-> Very good crafting system (only the cost is a little unbalanced) and search engine. Very easy to use and search. You can make how many decks you want and keep testing them in the AI modes or casual.7#-> Good store, there is not many things to buy yet, but it's very nice to look at it and as I said in 5# not a P2W game,  you can buy thing with gold and for real money, most of things are cosmetic.-------------Obs: I still need to play ranked to test it and try to invite some friends to test if there is a possibility to create or play in a room against them. (later I will do that and update this review).-------------Conclusion: Very Good F2P game, but I can't recommend it yet because of 1#, 2# and 3# Major Cons. I will change to recommended as soon they fix and balance more the game (I'm have a good feeling about the next patchs).",0, early access reviewgood concept card game moment work power cards maybe correct future adding ways search add power deck like mtg removing need deck power update review future send patchs game like getting tons power cards getting lost count times played straight turns getting power cards getting turns kind thing need skilled player need set hat leaf clovers rabbit foot trash cards good cards cost huge stones absurd crafting cost pass stones maybe balance cards reduce crafting cost better game open deck need deck power cards limitation helps major cons deck options reduced control aggro midrange deck types tournament decks info burn earlygame types decks cool fun play win rate probably lower types mentioned implement kind matchmaking system casual observed basically actual system oh found player level win lose rate balance kind thing new players destroyed old players small problem created new mode puzzles good mode feel rewards low comparing ones maybe add chests gold campaign pretty good learn fast game works basic ai modes good puzzles gauntlet forge puzzles good experience card habilities need smart moves finish gauntlet kind mortal kombat tower defeat enemies fight big boss hability benefits deck help forge like gauntlet random pack cards create deck use end mode need spend gold real money casual ranked draft cool play casual animations game design great opinion lot effects cards play game devices pcs laptops tablets need good pc play thing think improve interaction player field blizzard heartstone game interact amazing rewards need spend tons money good cards farm playing game huge time good crafting system cost little unbalanced search engine easy use search decks want testing ai modes good store things buy nice look said game buy thing gold real money things need play ranked test try invite friends test possibility create play room later update good game recommend major cons change recommended soon fix balance game good feeling patchs

For there are no suprises here and no real innovation.

At lowest level, they only play 1-2 relevant spells per game.Finally you can play some other formats, including ranked and ""draft"".About ""draft"" - instead of drafting against human opponents, you are drafting vs AI (but you play vs humans), what really kills that format. Yeah sure, it saves waiting time, but it makes the format pointless.Even I managed to go 7-1 in my first ""draft"", I was upgraded to silver rank (and then gold) soon and then it became really hard.By that time, I still found that the game was kind of fun, and decided to buy the founder pack, to get the campaign cards quickly. 5 days later I completely regret the desision.

1906,4770,4774,SMITE®,"I never thought I could spend so many time in a game. I'm not a multiplayer gamer nor a competitor. However, when you finally pick a god that fits your style of combat, you want to become better and better. You polish your skills and see the results. At this point, you become aware of the capabilities and limits of your god. You see when he can be very dangerous or very weak. But you have to experiment this against all the gods and adapt your tactics. As an Arena Mode player in assassin style, I always hit and run, keeping myself mobile, checking my distance with the opponent and strike where he doesn't wait me. I support the main assault with flanking manoeuvers, divide the opposite team to spread them out. But you have to synchronise yourself with your team to maximise the results. Don't stay alone, it's a TEAM based game. And that's why you should have a friend or more to play with to become more effective.  Smite offers many gods to play with. But to handle only one of them it takes time. Despite of lack of balance between them for some ones, the real strenght of a god depends on how you use it. Also, don't be afraid to try the various game modes which require different strategy each time.It's not a pay to win here. Everything can be done in game and if you want to spend money, it's for cosmetics. That's a good point when you know many companys like to play with our wallet today. Sadly, I must say that the game became more and more unstable recently. Now I always play 1/3 match with someone quitting the game for whatever reason. If not in my team, it's the opposite.

1916,10277,10281,theHunter Classic,"I've played a lot of this game outside of Steam. I switched over to make patching easier.It's a niche game. It also does cost some real money to get geared up and about $3/month for full access. Playing this game via microtransactions isn't the way to go if you're starting, get a bundle. $50 will get you solid amount of gear and a year of the full game. They have cheaper bundles too. The free to play part of the game is closer to a demo, though with rotating species and in game currency, it's doable if you're really that broke. However, the cost to play does go back into the game and it has grown significantly over the years I've played it. There are a huge number of reserves and species. The game itself is probably the best hunting game around. I don't know of another that offers the same realistic and challenging gameplay. Stalking and making your shots count is very important and getting a trophy or rare animal feels like an accomplishment due to the challenge of even finding those types of animals.If the Steam achievement percentages mean anything, only about 1-2% of people will play this game beyond a couple of hours. That's OK, like I said it's a niche game and not for everyone. But for those who like slower paced challenges and a fairly realistic hunting experience will enjoy what's there. Don't let the mixed reviews dissaude you from trying it out. There's enough of the game there for free to decide whether it's for you.",1, played lot game outside steam switched patching easier niche game cost real money geared month access playing game microtransactions way starting bundle solid gear year game cheaper bundles free play game closer demo rotating species game currency doable broke cost play game grown significantly years played huge number reserves species game probably best hunting game know offers realistic challenging gameplay stalking making shots count important getting trophy rare animal feels like accomplishment challenge finding types animals steam achievement percentages mean people play game couple hours ok like said niche game like slower paced challenges fairly realistic hunting experience enjoy let mixed reviews dissaude trying game free decide

The game is serviceable - if you're willing to ignore the games glairing fault. Its community.

No nothing happened. Good times were had with this game. But playing this with other people makes me concerned for my own sanity. Thus making it impossible to recommend this game to anyone.

1923,16250,16255,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"FREE GUN PORN!!!World of Guns: Gun Disassembly (WoG) is essentially a catalogue of exploded diagrams for various firearms, except instead of two-dimensional isometric drawings, the component parts have been meticulously modelled in three dimensions.  What’s more, the component models can be manipulated, both individually and as assemblies.  The camera controls (e.g. pan, tilt, zoom, track, etc.) allow fly-throughs of the models from any perspective, even those that would prove impractical in reality.  There are also cutaway views and several levels of x-ray views, in addition to the lovingly rendered photorealistic finishes.  What’s more, the actions of each model have been animated, and the animations can be run at normal speed or a number of slow-motion speeds, with any of the views!  This allows study of the ingenious mechanisms (e.g. springs, levers, cams, index wheels, gas porting, etc.) at a level simply unavailable anywhere outside the digital realm.The game aspect of WoG involves dismantling and reassembling the guns, with challenges based on speed and accuracy.  There is also a shooting range, although only a few of the guns can be used for target shooting.Some of the models allow alternative parts to be fitted, such as different size magazines and custom grips, and some allow you to mount accessories such as suppressors and scopes.  There is also a paint mode, where budding graphic designers and modellers can create custom skins for the models.The firearms catalogue is quite extensive and growing all the time, with community voting used to decide which models should be developed next.  The majority of the catalogue is not initially available, being unlocked with experience points earned by performing tasks with the unlocked models.  It is possible to purchase the entire library, but I would not recommend doing so immediately, as the higher complexity models will be very daunting before developing some familiarity with the system.  It appears that there are also other, non-firearm models available for purchase, such as automobiles and animal skeletons, but I have not explored this.  There is also a significant body of community-created content available via the Steam Workshop.I recommend that anybody with even a remote interest in firearms or mechanical engineering download and try WoG.  The price is impossible to argue with, and there is a chance that it will prove fascinating.",1, free gun guns gun disassembly wog essentially catalogue exploded diagrams firearms instead dimensional isometric drawings component parts meticulously modelled dimensions component models manipulated individually assemblies camera controls pan tilt zoom track etc allow fly throughs models perspective prove impractical reality cutaway views levels x ray views addition lovingly rendered photorealistic finishes actions model animated animations run normal speed number slow motion speeds views allows study ingenious mechanisms springs levers cams index wheels gas porting etc level simply unavailable outside digital realm game aspect wog involves dismantling reassembling guns challenges based speed accuracy shooting range guns target shooting models allow alternative parts fitted different size magazines custom grips allow mount accessories suppressors scopes paint mode budding graphic designers modellers create custom skins models firearms catalogue extensive growing time community voting decide models developed majority catalogue initially available unlocked experience points earned performing tasks unlocked models possible purchase entire library recommend immediately higher complexity models daunting developing familiarity system appears non firearm models available purchase automobiles animal skeletons explored significant body community created content available steam workshop recommend anybody remote interest firearms mechanical engineering download try price impossible argue chance prove fascinating

1926,3798,3801,Team Fortress 2," PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE TAKING IN ALL OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS Here's the deal... everyone has grown to love TF2 over the years with it's amazing style and goofy gameplay. Nothing can replace TF2 and the many memories we've had over the years. When many people saw this new update, they were furious with how Valve seemed to have broken TF2. It was bad but not as bad as you might think because it was just the surface... hear me out and I will attempt to address many key concerns(This is information from an official Valve post)    1.  The casual only having few modes            -Valve stated that the small amount of modes was their way of trying to reduce Day-One update release server overflow. With only 2 modes, the players would be spread out among all servers and lag and wait time would be minimum. They did not say this however and the servers still died on a massive scale.            -you WILL be able to choose your MAP and GAMEMODE in the future as always    2.  Wait times being sluggish            -server issues are being worked out at the time this is being written and wait times are supposed to be obsolete when it is fixed    3. Ranking in casual             -ranks are intented to be purely cosmetic and only to give incentive to play more. they are not related to competitive AT ALL     4. Penalties for leaving             -these were intended to make you stay the whole game but ended up just making players angry so they are being removedThe bottom line is that this update had VERY GOOD INTENTIONS, but Valve executed it in a VERY POOR FASHION. They made changes but did not give the background information that the community needed to hear. This ultimately lead to a very bad release.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT TF2 IS DEAD  (though it nearly freaking killed it) VALVE IS STILL LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY AND IS LOOKING TO FIX ANY AND ALL ISSUES WITH THE UPDATE In summary, TF2 is an amazing game that has a special place in the hearts of many including my own. It pains me to see it be injured by Valve itself and then have the community bash it so much. I wanted to put this out there so that people know that Valve is trying to help TF2 and not kill it, and I ask that you guys be open for the next few weeks as TF2 is modified. I'm still giving this a negative review because the state TF2 is currently in deserves a negative review. Once this is all resolved (I sincerely hope that is true), I will remove this review.Hopefully this helps some of you guys,Keep Teleporting BreadPeace out...~TEEJ44",0, read taking negative reviews deal grown love years amazing style goofy gameplay replace memories years people saw new update furious valve broken bad bad think surface hear attempt address key information official valve post casual having modes stated small modes way trying reduce day update release server overflow modes players spread servers lag wait time minimum servers died massive scale able choose map gamemode future wait times sluggish issues worked time written wait times supposed obsolete fixed ranking casual intented purely cosmetic incentive play related competitive penalties leaving intended stay game ended making players angry removedthe line update good intentions valve executed poor fashion changes background information community needed hear ultimately lead bad release mean dead nearly freaking killed valve listening community looking fix issues update summary amazing game special place hearts including pains injured valve community bash wanted people know valve trying help kill ask guys open weeks modified giving negative review state currently deserves negative review resolved sincerely hope true remove review hopefully helps guys teleporting breadpeace

1930,6243,6247,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThe game is great fun when you get past the beginning levels, to a certain extent. At first, it is a very unique and exiciting shooter, having everyone roll out into an objective with a jeep, is pretty cool. After a couple of games, this starts to become repetitive and a bit tedious. The charge across road, hide in forest, capture objective, is a fairly solid idea however it quickly bores, in my opinion. Even when this is fun, which is 50% of the time, when you have an epic firefight across the forests and storm objectives, it does feel a bit tedious at times, you die drive another jeep in die, again and again and again. Despite this, it is great fun when everything in the game comes together, the tank crews rolling in, parachuters dropping down and airplanes bombing you this way and that. When all of these things occur at the same time it is great, and this happens quite often. However, there are a variety of factors that drag this down, not just because of game mechanics, but perhaps also because of the community and players. It gets annoying when you charge into an objective, get sniped, do it again, get sniped, do it again, get sniped and so on. Plenty of people are going to say, ""That's your own fault for being stupid HERDURR,"" the problem is,  there's not much else I can do as an infantry man. I can sit back and try and snipe people? But this isn't really a factor in this game. There's not much you can do but charge, machine gun and die, the marksman factor of this game exsists but it's not very effective, and there's no other gameplay mechanics that change this. An example I can use is Planetside 2 or Arma, where it is a perfectly reasonable option to just surround the objective and starve out your enemies, something that doesn't happen in this game. That might just be the way I feel about this game, but it is my review. Finally, in my big rant, there are times when I just want to smash my pc to pieces. There is nothing more annoying than a tank destroyer creeping around into the rear and blowing up every tank that spawns because the turrets are too slow to turn, and no one can blow up the enemy tank because anti tank items are too 'pay to win' and most people don't seem to even know about them.The game has got a very large and annoying pay to win system, don't get me wrong it's a great game, graphics are great, gameplay is great, but pay to win and annoying tactics and repetition lets this game down, so overall I'd give it a 7.5/10. This is just what I've seen from the game, people may disagree but that's what I think.",1, early access reviewthe game great fun past beginning levels certain extent unique exiciting shooter having roll objective jeep pretty cool couple games starts repetitive bit tedious charge road hide forest capture objective fairly solid idea quickly bores opinion fun time epic firefight forests storm objectives feel bit tedious times die drive jeep die despite great fun game comes tank crews rolling parachuters dropping airplanes bombing way things occur time great happens variety factors drag game mechanics community players gets annoying charge objective sniped sniped sniped plenty people going fault stupid herdurr problem infantry man sit try snipe people factor game charge machine gun die marksman factor game exsists effective gameplay mechanics change example use planetside arma perfectly reasonable option surround objective starve enemies happen game way feel game review finally big rant times want smash pc pieces annoying tank destroyer creeping rear blowing tank spawns turrets slow turn blow enemy tank anti tank items pay win people know game got large annoying pay win system wrong great game graphics great gameplay great pay win annoying tactics repetition lets game overall seen game people disagree think

1945,2829,2832,War Thunder,"Got mixed opinions about this game and I play tanks mostly at the moment.  On steam I only got 602hrs since typing this but that doesnt include playing this game not through steam for over a year when I was the most active playing.  My current opinion though is I have been slowly moving away from this game because its a struggle to play anything that uses solid AP rounds as spalling is very lacking making tanks with APHE more effective.  Then theres the screwed up BR system as where tanks face others that will struggle alot against which will cause trouble especially for players that havent gotten the stronger tanks where as I have rank 5 tanks in every nation except brit.  I sometimes go back to play lower tier tanks for fun and always seem to get upranked all the time which makes it extremely hard but can handle it since I know almost all of the tanks weaknesses and such.  But this for new players will cause people to stop playing much sooner.  Currently the game needs alot of work especially in BR, DM, spalling, and much more before the game is perfect.

Eternal actually has some depth to it, and skill comes into play much more often than RNG does. Perhaps best of all, you can try this game completely free and get plenty of cards to use in countless ways in various decks. It's really all up to your imagination, as far as deckbuilding goes. And even without tons of legendaries you can make any sort of homebrew deck that still has a competitive edge to it. Not top-tier obviously, but still good enough to play competitively and, most importantly, have fun.That's the keyword here: FUN. Can you honestly say that Hearthstone is still fun?

1960,7210,7214,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I played this game before it launched on Steam. It's okay. It's 90% Hearthstone with some new mechanics and faster ramp to mid-game. The promotion of cards (where cards you own get permanently impproved) feels like a mechanic that gives long-time players a serious edge over newcomers, which might be a problem in the future. But it's free and very generous in dispensing card packs, so there's very little to keep you from just trying it yourself.Edit: After playing this game some more, I'm now of a mind to caution people about what they are getting into. I like the gameplay far more than I do Hearthstone, as there is a lot more dynamic on the board through heavy removals and influencers. But I do agree that it is P2W, or at least as much as Hearthstone is.Once you get through the newbie ranks, you'll start hitting the opponents with more legendaries and promoted cards. Some builds have more than 10 legendaries in them. And they are legendary for a reason. On the flip-side, the cost of crafting cards are the same as in Hearthstone, while the chance of drawing a card is considerably less (TESL uses 50 card decks, so 1/50 at the start of the game). This means that crafted cards have less impact on a build and it will take longer to catch up to the people who decided to spend money on packs and exclusives (ie: cards you'll never get if you don't pay for them).I still enjoy the game and I hope you will too. It's just a shame that this balancing issue is woven so deeply into the business model of this game.",0, played game launched steam okay hearthstone new mechanics faster ramp mid game promotion cards cards permanently impproved feels like mechanic gives long time players edge newcomers problem future free generous dispensing card packs little trying edit playing game mind caution people getting like gameplay far hearthstone lot dynamic board heavy removals influencers agree hearthstone newbie ranks start hitting opponents legendaries promoted cards builds legendaries legendary reason flip cost crafting cards hearthstone chance drawing card considerably tesl uses card decks start game means crafted cards impact build longer catch people decided spend money packs exclusives ie cards pay enjoy game hope shame balancing issue woven deeply business model game

1967,14957,14962,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewThis game was great, and I mean great. But the downfall started when they took out the Pilot Seat. That was, in my opinion, the best part.

Sure, if you're big you get bigger, but smaller ones have to keep working at twice the rate of the big robots. A big robot can just stick some weapons on a cube and never die, and the tiny robots cant afford the CPU to have that big a creation, and as such are easier to take down.

While it has some interesting new mechanics, it's in essence just straight-up intellectual property theft.  It was enjoyable for a while, until I realized that it has learned none of the balance lessons that were learned by MtG over the years: they use rarity as a balancing factor, something MtG figured out was fun-kiling very early on, and they have lots of cards and mechanics that reward luck over good play.  What finally drove me away from the game was the atrocious mulligan system.  You get a single mulligan, and the new hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 lands.  There's no guarantee that they'll be the proper color lands in a multicolor deck, and the game has clear problems with its RNG as it'll land starve/flood players far more regularly than is statistically likely.  These factos combine to render a large number of games unplayable by one side or the other.  When these games happen in the play-at-will constructed multiplayer it's annoying but not a huge deal.

They could have handled the world system better but the atlas is a nice touch though but I miss having the random world generated spawning and all that (Haven't tested the worlds when I got back on because I disconnect a lot now). I disconnect a lot more than usual now. If Trove has an oceania server and I was connected to it, then this must be a poor server but if there wasn't, then they should probably have at least one.

Stay away from this game if you don't want to spend money. Business model seems less greedy if you compare it with HS, MtG, or YGO, but who cares about them when there is a much more generous ccg on the market.If you are willing to invest like $50 then this game would be good, but I bet they'll get more greedy in the future once the game gets bigger, just like HS all over again.

I spend $0 and have completed every single meta deck in every meta cycle over there. That's my expectation for any free card game right now, the ability to play every good meta decks without spending a single cent while only playing nothing more than daily quest everyday (no grinding).tl;dr;- more p2w than SV- more RNG dependant than SV (prophecy rng wtf)- less players than SV- too much paying player advantage- single player content that needs to be bought, ala HS- much better game than Hearthstone in every aspect, but far less players",0, tried game good hearthstone clones like comon adventure huge disparity spenders players stuff special offers buy stay away game want spend money business model greedy compare hs mtg ygo cares generous ccg market willing invest like game good bet greedy future game gets bigger like hs admit tempting spend starter pack stay away game play shadowverse better business model typical money sucking card game spend completed single meta deck meta cycle expectation free card game right ability play good meta decks spending single cent playing daily quest everyday rng dependant sv prophecy rng players paying player single player content needs bought ala better game hearthstone aspect far players

2016,11297,11301,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewAn online game that freely rewards you just for playing against IA ALWAYS deserves a positive review! I've played like 10-12 hours on Steam and maybe another 20-25 on my phone. Not much but I'm giving my point of view.I'm a person who always expects a lot from a game. If it doesn't fit my tastes, then I quickly drop it after an intensive period of trial, so first the negative points:CONS:- The collection is really extensive, and the possibility to have in your deck 4 copies of a same card, including legendaries, makes me think this is not purely F2P.- The crafting system is unbalanced aswel. You can't disenchant a Premium card for half the cost of making that same Non-premium card. Just for those of us who enjoy a ""complete collection without glowing things"". Please take that as an advice. PLEASE DEVELOPERS. ^_^- TURN ONE. Guys, you forgot to make up for the player who starts second. Resource differences here are maybe not essential, and the blocking system seems fair... but still, the 1st player can have 2 or even 3 units on board in the second turn while the second player has nothing.-----> This isn't a CON: The resource system can sometimes make you lose a game, yes, but hey, that's why there are ""draw emblem"" cards. To cycle and thin your deck.And that's why the game itself forces you to include a 33% of power cards in a deck. The ""old general rule"" in any classic card game.What happens in Hearthstone when you have an awful start while your opponent has a very good one?PROS:- Pretty much anything else. Animations and graphics, card design, controls, rules, atmosphere...- A cheap and challenging way to try your skills and decks out against IA, and getting cards. You can earn gold in Gauntlet then spend it in Forge. Free, without having to play against experienced or P2W players.- A HUGE BUNCH of mechanics. Making a crazy deck is really fun although 90% times it can be garbage :D- LOTS of game modes. That got me.So, if you want some kind of complexity and a huge collection to complete, mixed with intuitive mechanics and amazing tutorials... Try the game. At least. It's free.An easy 8/10.

2027,8909,8913,PlanetSide 2,"First things first:The game is controversial. Dont get fooled by my playtime. Combined with my time using the SOE launcher my gametime goes into multiple thousands of hours so here my advise.If u wanna go alone and just grind guns, stay away from it. You will find the grind tedious, you will be outgunned by people who are worse than you, but win because they gang up on you.Im not saying u cant have fun in the game going solo from time to time. I do so myself.The actual joy comes in when you become part of a team. Doesnt matter if you are an elitist in your small squad of energdrinking, doritoeating memelords or you are being a small part of a way bigger machine playing continent wide king of the hill. While doing so the certs u need for all of your upgrade will come along the way.Actual review:Overview:We have here an MMOFPS, in which u can play one of three factions (or all of them) that emphasives the management of population and the right form of deployment. In a nutshell, when u are bringing 12 guys deployed as light infantry and you are going against 48 players going at you combined arms style, you are in for a rough ride and should question the sanity of your squadlead.When two armies are managed properly and are going at each other. then you are in for an experience that is unrivaled across all games Im aware of.The factions you can play are supposed to be asymetricly balanaced, but in reality the only realy difference are the gunsounds with a different gimmick here and there. To make a perfectly inaccurate statement. NC: hits hard, fires slow. TR: has big magazines. VS: has fast reload speed and no bullet drop (the bullet drop isnt so handy though)Graphics and optimization:The graphics aged well. The game is from 2012 and on ultrasettings u will get some cool visuals. However the optimization is far from perfect, so u need a decent rig to able to play the game on low settings. Its recommended for all lowend rigs to completely turn of shadow and light effects.Gunplay:This game uses clientside. If you dont know what that means pls use google before you read on. The TTK when playing infantry vs. infantry is pretty high (6-8 hits). There are a lot of shiny things u can use use to upgrade you class, but they are not of any use if u dont understand clientside. People camping in corners will be in a disadvantage in this game. Also because of the high TTK, infantry combat is relatively close quarterish compared with other games.Vehiclegameplay:I wont go into ground vehicles here since, well everyone knows what they can expect from them. There are tanks, armoured trooptransports and what have ya. Not that different from what already exists IRL.However the airgame is different from u might have experience in other games. The flying vehicles in the game all kind of act like attack helicopters. This is due to the ability to hover that all airvehicle have. This turns dogfights into helicopter battles where the combatants usually face each other instead of getting on the six of one another. If u wanna be more than cannonfodder in the air you also need lots of practice since the more advanced manouvers are not really intuitive and need practice. There are some good vids on youtube for that.PSW? :There is nothing currently avaiable in the game that cant be earned through just playing the game. However camos and other cosmetics are only dropped when u win an alert and its a random drop.So if u really wanna have a certain shiny thing on your armor u might help out your grandpa in the garden and invest the moneys u get there in shinys.All other things can be aquired by certification points that u get every 250 xp points or so. As stated above if you are just playing this game for the grind, while also going solo, u will have a hard time to aquire the certs u want to unlock the much needed upgrades on you utility slots.General advise: The basic guns u get to start with are the most versatile. Investing your first certs in the actual class abilites and slots will upgrade your char more than a 1k cert gun that u just bought because some good players use it.There are implants in the game that can be bought in lootboxes, with certs or with real cash. I think the mechanic is problematic but the implants are not. These implants give you tiny or nice to have gimmics that improve the qulity of life but dont make you inherently stronger. You can have the best implants in the game. When you dont know how to clientside u still get rekt.It is worth noting here, that if the main continent (the one with most population) often has a queue to get into if u play the faction with most population. If u aquire membership (also give a bit more xp) u will be treated with priority.I cant give definitive answer here since I guess that the whole PSW needs more definition. I can tolerate it.",1, things game controversial nt fooled playtime combined time soe launcher gametime goes multiple thousands hours advise u wanna grind guns stay away find grind tedious outgunned people worse win gang im saying u nt fun game going solo time time actual joy comes team nt matter elitist small squad energdrinking doritoeating memelords small way bigger machine playing continent wide king hill certs u need upgrade come way actual review overview mmofps u play factions emphasives management population right form deployment nutshell u bringing guys deployed light infantry going players going combined arms style rough ride question sanity squadlead armies managed properly going experience unrivaled games m aware factions play supposed asymetricly balanaced reality realy difference gunsounds different gimmick perfectly inaccurate statement nc hits hard fires slow tr big magazines vs fast reload speed bullet drop bullet drop nt handy optimization graphics aged game ultrasettings u cool visuals optimization far perfect u need decent rig able play game low settings recommended lowend rigs completely turn shadow light effects gunplay game uses clientside nt know means pls use google read ttk playing infantry infantry pretty high hits lot shiny things u use use upgrade class use u nt understand clientside people camping corners disadvantage game high ttk infantry combat relatively close quarterish compared games vehiclegameplay wo nt ground vehicles knows expect tanks armoured trooptransports ya different exists airgame different u experience games flying vehicles game kind act like attack helicopters ability hover airvehicle turns dogfights helicopter battles combatants usually face instead getting u wanna cannonfodder air need lots practice advanced manouvers intuitive need practice good vids youtube psw currently avaiable game nt earned playing game camos cosmetics dropped u win alert random drop u wanna certain shiny thing armor u help grandpa garden invest moneys u shinys things aquired certification points u xp points stated playing game grind going solo u hard time aquire certs u want unlock needed upgrades utility slots general advise basic guns u start versatile investing certs actual class abilites slots upgrade char cert gun u bought good players use implants game bought lootboxes certs real cash think mechanic problematic implants implants tiny nice gimmics improve qulity life nt inherently stronger best implants game nt know clientside u rekt worth noting main continent population queue u play faction population u aquire membership bit xp u treated priority nt definitive answer guess psw needs definition tolerate

2037,13248,13252,Fallout Shelter,"Fallout Shelter is your usual idle mobile game with a bit of simulation and some clicking. Made by Bethesda and Behaviour Entertainment, released first in 2015 on iOS and other mobile, updated significantly since then, arrived to PC in 2016 and to Steam in 2017.Technically, it does have occasional glitch fixed by restarting game, such as when I couldn't remove elevator. And people say that they had their saves wiped out due to error or crash many hours later. So uncool.And eh, idle games are idle games. As far as I care, they are soulless.

The only microtransactions are either boxes of random stuff that you can get as loot anyway and ability to arrive to quests immeditly, doesn't matter much. Usually you can leave the game for a while unless you sent dwellers out exploring, then it goes against whole idle thing with them possibly dieing out of injury while you aren't paying attention.I mean, it's not Pay-2-Win but it's still an idle game which is completely shameful on PC.It's actually funny how game was different combat systems in shelter and quests. In shelter animation matter zero, everybody's health is just getting slowly sapped by presence of NPCs with their stats and only Endurance stat matters for health. Quest kinda does it more with aiming, attacks, critical hits minigames at rare times. But eh, still shallow.And yea, it's idle. I played normal vault for a while and stopped very quickly after realizing at how easy it will be. So I tried survival instead. And boy, instead of proper challenge I got cheese-land of cheesy tactics. It's hard but in merely annoying way, not the way that makes you think or tests you.Here are some examples of these pro tactics that are based off real life:Nothing bad ever happens if you don't pay attention to things. In survival mode you will be bombared with incidents every few minutes which will be sapping away health of your dwellers so in nutshell you want to do stuff and leave ASAP. Leave workers to live happily and restore health, for we all know that presence of exploitative class brings only unhappyness and bad luck.Just like in real life the best way to handle conflicts is just run away and ignore it. Right? So if you ever get incidents, in order not to get health of dwellers sapped away, you just have to move them away from whatever or whoever is invading you. If it's internal then it will spread to horizontal and vertical rooms and then end. Which also brings the only non-cheesy tactics of how to build base, aha. And if it's from outside then they just go through each row back and forth to the bottom and then go away. Just send dwellers to rooms where they already passed. It doesn't even matter if they have to go through fire on the way, it only takes away health if they are assigned to same room. Raiders also sap away recources while in shelter but in early game it's quicker to just let them run through than confort, thus takes less recources.Did you know that pregnant women are the best workers? While they can't fight back or do quests or explore, their AI is set to always run from incidents, practically making them completely invincible. And you wait forever about bringing babies out of their bellies. What an utopia.It also seems that if you have too much population then their odor will spread all over the wastelands, bringing bigger threat in. As a result you will have to stop at certain population and then wait patiently as you grab the needed loot. Send people on quests and exploration to gain better equipment before getting bigger. Idling. Don't upgrade to level 3 rooms early either, makes bigger internal incidents there.Overall, I quickly realized that in order to progress in Survival I will have to wait for days to get better equipment and once I got into the fairly stable movement in the game I figured that this mobile idle game can't provide any more proper enjoyment and left the game.I've won.",0, fallout shelter usual idle mobile game bit simulation clicking bethesda behaviour entertainment released ios mobile updated significantly arrived pc steam occasional glitch fixed restarting game remove elevator people saves wiped error crash hours later uncool eh idle games idle games far care soulless game bit soul artstyle neat universe cartoon thing nice mhm wins games player fully maxes hours nope loses player wins checks goes away gets shallow tried normal play base building basic recource management wait long time smthing rush percentage wrong microtransactions boxes random stuff loot ability arrive quests immeditly matter usually leave game sent dwellers exploring goes idle thing possibly dieing injury paying attention mean win idle game completely shameful actually funny game different combat systems shelter quests shelter animation matter zero everybody health getting slowly sapped presence npcs stats endurance stat matters health quest kinda aiming attacks critical hits minigames rare times eh shallow yea idle played normal vault stopped quickly realizing easy tried survival instead boy instead proper challenge got cheese land cheesy tactics hard merely annoying way way makes think tests examples pro tactics based real life bad happens pay attention things survival mode bombared incidents minutes sapping away health dwellers nutshell want stuff leave asap leave workers live happily restore health know presence exploitative class brings unhappyness bad luck like real life best way handle conflicts run away ignore right incidents order health dwellers sapped away away invading internal spread horizontal vertical rooms end brings non cheesy tactics build base aha outside row forth away send dwellers rooms passed matter fire way takes away health assigned room raiders sap away recources shelter early game quicker let run confort takes recources know pregnant women best workers fight quests explore ai set run incidents practically making completely invincible wait forever bringing babies bellies utopia population odor spread wastelands bringing bigger threat result stop certain population wait patiently grab needed loot send people quests exploration gain better equipment getting bigger idling upgrade level rooms early makes bigger internal incidents overall quickly realized order progress survival wait days better equipment got fairly stable movement game figured mobile idle game provide proper enjoyment left game won

2039,15701,15706,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewAs it says, this is an Early Access Review. In other words, the game will improve over time. If you don't wish to play the game when it's incomplete, you aren't suitable for Beta Testing or any testing for that matter. Stay away from this currently incomplete game. (You have been warned).Just like every other AE game, this has the same concept. Farming. It's extremely grindy, like seriously. If you hate any form of grinding or TOO MUCH grinding, then stay away as well.There are new features such as crafting and now even the Pumpkin Lord Armour is farmable. Which is a great step forward for non-p2p players. In other words, it is more farmy and less cashy. Just like how an AE game should be.For anyone that complained that the PumpkinLord armour is too hard to farm due to low levels joining in the dungeon, they have capped it and is now much more easy.A new area has been released and guess what? More farming! Before anyone starts complaining that the hard area is too hard, it's probably because you're too low level. (Basically a newbie. NOT AN INSULT HERE.)I take back my previous statement about levels being less important though. They are super important because the best armour currently available in game is level 15.If you're new to AE games, I really don't recommend this because the story DOES NOT FLOW. Yes. AE games are made in such a way that if you never played any other games made by them, the story will feel very weird and rushed. As a long time player of ALL their games, I can say that their lore is extremely deep. For example, the plot twist about Artix and Gravelyn actually makes sense. If you looked back at their past storyline, you'll actually see why. Sepulchure's backstory is personally my favourite (And the way he died T^T)Basically, if you want to start on this game, PLAY ALL OF ITS PREQUELS.If you wish to just jump into this game without any knowledge of how AE games work, you will have a 50% chance of either loving it, or hating it.",1, early access reviewas says early access review words game improve time wish play game incomplete suitable beta testing testing matter stay away currently incomplete game like ae game concept farming extremely grindy like seriously hate form grinding grinding stay away new features crafting pumpkin lord armour farmable great step forward non players words farmy cashy like ae game complained pumpkinlord armour hard farm low levels joining dungeon capped easy new area released guess farming starts complaining hard area hard probably low level basically newbie insult previous statement levels important super important best armour currently available game level new ae games recommend story flow yes ae games way played games story feel weird rushed long time player games lore extremely deep example plot twist artix gravelyn actually makes sense looked past storyline actually sepulchure backstory personally favourite way died want start game play wish jump game knowledge ae games work chance loving hating
2040,4837,4841,SMITE®,"Oh Smite. First off, I do have a few hundred unlogged hours from when Smite wasn't on Steam.Smite holds a very special place in my heart, it is one of, if not my favourite multiplayer game of all time. Played since Beta, and I've had REALLY long breaks from it from time to time, months long. But I seem to always come back. To me, it's easily better than League and Dota, just because of the easier learning curve, and potential for much faster paced games. I've always hated the entire early game of League, as it is pretty much just clicking minions for 10 minutes or so. I'm also not a fan of clicking to move.This is where Smite came in. It's primary premise was to be a third-person MOBA. And my god did they nail it. The abilities, action and synergy between gods is great, among other key gameplay aspects. Ask anybody, and they will say that it's glory days are over. And while that may be true, Smite is still the same core experience, with a more complete roster of more diverse gods. The reasons why it's glory days are over?1) Community has indeed, gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Early on, the community was one of the best, although I think that's true of most Beta games/new games.2) A couple of key people working on the design team of HiRez left to work on other games and projects within HiRez. Basically, instead of returning an investment to improve and prolong Smite, HiRez thought it would be a good idea to do a handful of smaller projects. Really only Paladins was successful, but this still draws resources and manpower away from Smite, as HiRez is still a pretty small dev company. They tried a bunch of card games and mobile games, and really just wasted time and money. I'd personally reckon Smite suffered for this.  Now, the design team don't really know how to play the game at a high enough level to test balance properly, which REALLY makes balancing a huge issue at times for them. Even with all these issues, balance may not be very good, but it's definitely NOT as bad as some people make it out to be. And it sure is more balanced than a bunch of MP games out there.3) Matchmaking. I really never will understand at all how a matchmaking system can ever possibly think that a couple of silver level players get matched with Diamond & Platinum and even Grandmaster ranks. It's easily the worst thing about Smite. It's not even like there's not enough people queuing, there's still a modest-sized playerbase for ranked. The PERFECT example of how♥♥♥♥♥♥matchmaking is, is this story of how me and my friend got into a game with not just a pro player, but probably a top 3 midlaner in the world: It was a couple years ago, me and my friend just qualified for the new split, and got something like Gold IV. Now, gold is pretty bad, you definitely are NOT good at the game if you can't get out of gold. Yet somehow, someway, me and my friend got paired with a Silver, a Diamond player and this top 3 midlane pro in ranked. It's ♥♥♥♥ing mind-boggling.(Conclusion)I still love playing Smite, and it is still my favourite MP game, I just don't know if it's worth a new player trying to learn the game up to the point of playing ranked extensively, because of those three problems. If you want a casual, fun time learning the game with friends, this game is fantastic. I have tons of memories of that with my friends in the past, it was a blast. But if you have intentions to truly learn the game and get better with ranked, I can't recommend this game to you.",0, oh smite unlogged hours smite steam smite holds special place heart favourite multiplayer game time played beta long breaks time time months long come easily better league dota easier learning curve potential faster paced games hated entire early game league pretty clicking minions minutes fan clicking smite came primary premise person moba god nail abilities action synergy gods great key gameplay aspects ask anybody glory days true smite core experience complete roster diverse gods reasons glory days community gone early community best think true beta games new couple key people working design team hirez left work games projects hirez basically instead returning investment improve prolong smite hirez thought good idea handful smaller projects paladins successful draws resources manpower away smite hirez pretty small dev company tried bunch card games mobile games wasted time money personally reckon smite suffered design team know play game high level test balance properly makes balancing huge issue times issues balance good definitely bad people sure balanced bunch mp games matchmaking understand matchmaking system possibly think couple silver level players matched diamond platinum grandmaster ranks easily worst thing smite like people queuing modest sized playerbase ranked perfect example matchmaking story friend got game pro player probably midlaner world couple years ago friend qualified new split got like gold iv gold pretty bad definitely good game gold someway friend got paired silver diamond player midlane pro ranked ing mind love playing smite favourite mp game know worth new player trying learn game point playing ranked extensively problems want casual fun time learning game friends game fantastic tons memories friends past blast intentions truly learn game better ranked recommend game

2043,5351,5355,World of Tanks Blitz,"I've been playing the World of Tanks series of games (started out with normal World of Tanks for the PC, calling WoTM for now) for almost 6 years, and WoTB is quite a fun replacment. I lost my interest in WoTM because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, I used the Arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but I am skeptical), and when I was watching videos on WoTB, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and I desided to try it out, and I found it to be quite fun, and I have been playing it non-stop ever sense. PROS: Smaller matches compaired to WoTM means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. New Equipment System: Many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. And I will say, at first, I absolutly hated it. The new system allows players to mount 9 different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for ""Spare Parts"". Many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind IGC (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount 3 equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier 5 tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the Gun Stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier 8+ tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. Tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:There are tons of tanks in here, just like WoTM, bar Arty. If you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. If you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. If you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for Tank Destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. And as the game is still improving just like WoTM, more tanks are in the future. Good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as HD as WoTM, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but I am not into games for fancy graphics, I play for gameplay.Cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.Cons:Smaller matches compaired to WoTM. Although it has it's perks, if you come from WoTM, you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the 7 v 7.Spare Parts System: Although the new equipment system is good, I will say that the Spare Parts system is somewhat flawed. We should at least earn 1000 spare parts for a victory and maybe 250 for a loss. I've only won about 300 for a victory. This makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. The only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every 12-24 hours (forgot which lol) To be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - Update 3.10 claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. Overpowered tanks: Although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a Tiger II in real life would blow away a Sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. Some notable tanks are the Leopard Light Tank of tier 5, KV-2 of tier 6, LTTB of tier 7 to name a few. What makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the Leopard only had 2 varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. The KV-2 in game can 1 shot anything at tier 6 and below when using the 152mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. LTTB reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. The LTTB is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has 90mm of hull armor. I don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) However, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. Leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. KV-2 has an insanely long reload (upwords of 20+ seconds), and the LTTB is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.There is also somewhat of a ""Russian Bias"" with this game, and many of the Russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the German tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the German tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. And yes, I am parcial to German tanks, but I also use British, American, and Russian, so this is from personal experience. The new ""Millitary Honor"" system:Absolute **** in my eyes. I've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and I don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily I might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of  this new ""Millitary Honor"" system, you're ""honor"" stars go down because random players think you're botting, or AFKing when you could have issues like I am experiencing. In my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. And my final and main issue with the game: NO THREE MAN PLATOONS LIKE NORMAL WOTM - I understand that 7 v 7 might be difficult to have 3 man platoons, but we need something cause 2 man platoons is just too small. All I can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on WoTB for 3 man platoons for those that agree with this.Another thing for new players is DON'T JUDGE THE GAME UNTIL YOU'RE AT LEAST AT TIER 5, AND THIS GOES FOR WOTM AS WELL. I've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. It's not just ""point and click and get a kill"" (unless you're an old arty or KV-2, then it sometime is). There is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called ""sidescraping"", and many other things that will help you survive in battle. Learn you tank too. A Panzer IV will have a completely different playstyle than a T1 Heavy or KV-1 (these are all tier 5s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). Use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. Note: These are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. And that concludes this long winded review.

2049,6691,6695,Heroes & Generals,"For some reasons, first levels, you are matched with low level players and there are no vehicles. It's pure soldier fights. Then you reach level 5 (or something like that) and suddently there are vehicles everywhere, you are matched with very high players and the game suddendly become really uninteresting and annoying. I remember my first game with vehicles. No one had weapons to kill said vehicles in my team for simple reason that we were all too low level to have unlocked the weapons required to fight against vehicles. So we spent the game trying to avoid the unkillable armored vehicle of enemy team. Dont even need to mention that we lost because their armored vehicle was camping our spawn.The second game I joined: I spawned, started to run for 10 sec and suddently a plane dive on me and kill me... Spawn again, another plane dive on me and kill me... planes camping our spawn...The third game? There was no third game with vehicles. I uninstalled. I had fun til I reached the required level to have vehicles in my game which mean approximatively 10-15 games without vehicles. Then it was just a spawn camping boring fest.The decent items/weapons, you have to pay for them. This game is exactly what you can expect from greedy developers.  I hate to say it but I tried Battlefield 1 (even if I promised myself to never ever play this franchise because the last good BF game was BF2 and all games after it were just money grabbing pile of poop)... Well you want a good war game? Battlefield 1 is way better than previous BF games and honestly, the balance between weapons and vehicles was really good. I never felt overwhelmed by vehicles. Yes they are annoying but not unstoppable. If you want to invest few bucks, get BF1 and have some fun worth your money. Avoid Heroes and generals at all cost. You'll just waste your money into it.The only thing that was interesting in H&G was the ""general"" part of the game which is not open to new players. The best players are generals and they can take decisions on Europe map to decide where they are sending their soldiers. Goal of each side is to conquer all Europe. And then ordinary soldiers will fight for objective decided by their generals. Every win is a territory captured on the map. It's really interesting idea honestly. A part of the game is a kind of RTS and the other is FPS. But yeah, again, the greedy devs are making this game absolutely awful and unbalanced to play. Sadly. Too bad for them!

2051,3669,3672,Team Fortress 2,"This Game was really good till the latest ""Meet your Match"" Update.Now it is just bad and sucks a lot. Why?1. You are randomly moved to a Server and a Team. You can't choose your Team, Map and the Location of the Server. I was moved to a Server far away many times so I had a high Ping and it was unplayable.Other Teammates/Enemies having a High ping too and this causes unfair kills.2. Search Times are still very long.It takes like Minutes to finally find a Server.3. You just play a few Round on ONE Map and then you have to disconnect and search for a new Server.4. The Game Coordinator and API are down so often so you can't play (still 4-5x per Day).5. Teams are still unbalanced like hell and you have to play with your Team the WHOLE Map. I tried to play a few Rounds but it was balanced only one time. Even if you're on the good Team, it is not fun.6. Casual needs a lot of fixes, like a Class limit, Ping Limit etc. I don't want to play against Heavys or Engineers.7. Ranks are just pure cosmetics.8. Removing Autobalance is much worse than having it. Autobalance was hated but needed, now you play 12 vs 7 or 8 till someone joins your running match, but this takes too long.Team Fortress wanted to be like CS Go with the Skins and now it want to be Overwatch but it doesn't work. It is over 9 Years old and now they change everything?After playing Team Fortress over 2.300 Hours I'll do a long break. I don't have fun anymore.NEVER Stop a running System.

2054,2216,2219,Path of Exile,"- = Updated for 3.0 = -Update 3.0 has brought outstanding new changes to the game, performance is even better, and the amount of content continues to increase with the addition of a ten-act system instead of a ""three difficulty"" system like Diablo and other similar games adopted. The new expansion is coming out soon and I'm going to keep playing the heck out of it.- = Original review = -A true action RPG like no other.I've played Path of Exile since closed beta. I never can seem to stay away from it for too long, I always come back to play again.The game has excellent support by the developers, and has innovative new ways of spicing up the creation of a character to take on the hordes of evil.While most games take you on a brief joyride of skills for your specific class, Path of Exile sends you on a journey with its gem-based skill system. This system allows you to essentially create your own skill that works the way you want it to. You can make one fireball that pierces enemies and burns them for more damage, or make a fireball that deals less damage, but forks/splits into many fireballs on being cast instead. The customization of skills is baffling and infinitely useful within the game. The amount of creativity that go into making builds in the game is astounding. If you like making interesting characters and trying new ideas in RPGs, you will go crazy with Path of Exile.One of the other main points of this game is the class fluidity. You can pretty much make any of the classes play how you want. Your ""ranger"" can use heavy armor and a shield and be as tanky as any marauder or templar. The way you build your character is up to you and your creativity.The developers also support replayability of the game with ""race"" events. These events let players test their skill at starting fresh by racing through special dungeons, or through the campaign itself, in order to win rare items or other prizes for your more permanent characters on your account. Some of these events have PVP elements, while others are simply just challenges in surviving and progressing in interestingly-challenging settings that you otherwise wouldn't encounter in the game.If you enjoy having lots of options in an RPG, then you should definitely try Path of Exile.With it being free, you really can't go wrong. I donated over 60 dollars to this game during development, and I don't regret a single cent spent. But you can play it for free and enjoy it just as much.My only complaint is the desync... So much desync. :(9/10, will be playing it again.",1, updated brought outstanding new changes game performance better content continues increase addition act system instead difficulty system like diablo similar games adopted new expansion coming soon going playing heck original review true action rpg like played path exile closed beta stay away long come play game excellent support developers innovative new ways spicing creation character hordes evil games brief joyride skills specific class path exile sends journey gem based skill system system allows essentially create skill works way want fireball pierces enemies burns damage fireball deals damage forks splits fireballs cast instead customization skills baffling infinitely useful game creativity making builds game astounding like making interesting characters trying new ideas rpgs crazy path exile main points game class fluidity pretty classes play want ranger use heavy armor shield tanky marauder templar way build character creativity developers support replayability game race events events let players test skill starting fresh racing special dungeons campaign order win rare items prizes permanent characters account events pvp elements simply challenges surviving progressing interestingly challenging settings encounter game enjoy having lots options rpg definitely try path exile free wrong donated dollars game development regret single cent spent play free enjoy complaint desync desync playing

Yet.Anyways, my review of the game is yes, it's a very patience demanding game. Walking on trails through the lush forests of the reserves takes a while, but with the right equipment you can radically change your experience. I normally use some kind of bow for hunting but I also bought a nice .308 rifle for longer ranges and bigger game, I.E. Moose or bear. The bows are permitted to hunt EVERYTHING.

The races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer. The setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy. These cars, which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome! Hats off for near flawless multiplayer code! The free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars. There are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and the other a more narrow circuit similar to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every corner!I've yet to try the ""Get real"" difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars, but I do hope there are some pre-sets to chose from. The Jeoff Crammond Grand Prix games didn't have and see where that lead them... There are however some problems with the game. The first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least, no need for me to dig deeper into it, read the  other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content.The actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line, and I'd like to see different type of weather too, like rain for example. The leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some ""short cuts"" invalidating the lap.

2074,510,512,Sakura Clicker,"I think the best way to review a game like this is to break it down, in order to highlight everything properly:ART & DESIGN---------------Dude, 10/10 waifus. You got a huge array of waifus to punch, from the normal Cat, Fairy, and Dragon Girls, to the more out there Mud, Plant and Yuki-Onna Girls. And with each type of girl having a few different design assets, there's a surprising range of designs for the hoards of waifus you'll be clicking through. And if you're sad enough, you may even recognize a couple of assets, backgrounds, and girls from other Sakura games. And there's lots of diversity? You can also customize your player character, and if you shell out, you different little outfits for her, which, depending on the type of person you are, may interest you.SOUND-------I recommend playing this game 100% volume with no headphones to maximize the experience. The constant animu moaning that comes from this game is a wacky and fun thing to hear, and sometimes you get to hear Nya~!, which is, well, horrible, but the ironic charm is fantastic. This is all family friendly fun, you see.GAMEPLAY-----------It's your standard clicker game, where you click the waifus to add them to your harem (Yes, you punch monster girls to add them to your harem, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic) and get currency to purchase automatic clickers, and upgrades for them to make your clicks do more damage/make the automated attacks stronger/have little power ups. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but why fix what isn't broken? The clicker model has been proven, and this doesn't look to screw it up. The real differentiator comes from...DIFFICULTY CURVE--------------------Yo, this game gets pretty difficult in the end game. This clicker separates the men who wanna look at anime t*tties from the men who wanna play a decent clicker game, and also look at anime t*tties. You'll have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic, as well how to distribute points in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can, or else you'll plateu in progression. You'll have to take what you learn from previous runs in order to get better.OVERALL----------This game is a MASTERPIECE. Clicker games are tried and true fun times, and this game is no exception. But pair this with the dynamic, diverse waifu punching, the FANTASTIC sound design, and actual strategy involved, it takes the game from an ironic 7/10 meme to a fun 10/10 time waster clicker game. Also, the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash helps level progression, and will save you from racking up too many hours actually in game, sparing you from the embarrasment of your family, friends, and colleagues.

2075,10607,10611,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewBy Far, The Most Generous F2P Digital CCG I've PlayedSo, I've played Magic: the Gathering for 15 years or so. And the recent wave of digital CCGs have been nice, but overall lacking. They're super simplified to the point where a lot of the strategy and meaningful interaction seems to disappear. Additionally, they can be stingy with giving you access to the very cards you need to play the game.None of those apply to Eternal, from my time playing it.I've played for a few months, and have access to every common and uncommon in the two sets released as of the time of this writing, as well as most of the rares. Legendaries are still a crapshoot, but I have plenty of shiftstone to craft whatever Legendaries I need. I mean, packs just give you 100 shiftstone each, and you get a free pack for your first win of the day. The rewards are so plentiful, and you'll sometimes have a reward chest just randomly upgrade. (Those rare times you see a lowly copper chest upgrade all the way to platinum are just glorious.)Eternal feels like what Magic would look like if it was made now. All the strategy is there, and so much of my Magic knowledge easily ports over. Some things are streamlined, but not in a way that removes strategic depth. (No clunky phases, for example. Everything smoothly moves from start to combat to end and everything in between.) And all the interaction on your opponent's turn that other games shy away from? Not this game. (Similarly, it's not afraid to give you tools against cards sitting in your opponent's hand.)

2089,13811,13815,Dreadnought,"This is a space combat version of World of Warships/Tanks. Maybe not as graphically pretty but esseentially the same. You start with tier 1 ships that lead, via tech trees, to up to tier 5 ships. There are two aspects that cost money. tier 4 ships that look different and have more powerful weapons due to their tier but are ultimately less powerful than the tier 5 ships. You can also buy elite status that lets you earn the experience and currency needed to upgrade tech trees faster. Same formula as WoW/WoT. Any ships/tanks you can buy in those games are not max tier and are not as powerful as max tier. This game isn't perfect, but from what I've seen it is very good for a F2P game from a developer I've never heard of. The game is slightly different in the sense you have ships that can heal other ships, They do make it harder to destroy some of the heavily armor ships but thats the point. Find the healer ships and destroy those first. Its tactics. People just want to see what they aim at explode fast and hate having to use their brains. Play Team Fortress 2 and see how much of a pain a Heavy is to kill with a Medic healing him. Until the medic dies, then they all go down like everybody else if you focus fire. This game rewards teamwork and communication. I don't know the level of that you will get in a pick up game with random players. If you were to play this game with an actual team of communicating players, I could see them being very hard to stop. Unless you did the same. I've played a lot of WoT, its the same way. A team that works together and communicates nearly always outplays a team that just does whatever they want and doesn't communicate. The game has potential. Its F2P, give the devs the benefit of the doubt and give it a try.

2090,12799,12803,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games.  While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom.  The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely.  Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class.  Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are.  If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track.  Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.  Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price.  The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile.  They do include several tracks in the package.  So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release.  But you can clearly see they state ""Open Beta"" as of April 10, 2014.",0, thought origin asked aka ea comes microstransactions games client game free raceroom rest cars tracks handful free cost approx respecitvely mind model car variations like bmw m class tracks probably reasonable bought close real thing like included tracks free able buying track right probably easter sale pick cars tracks maybe note money steam wallet convert currency buy tracks cars wait special promotion multiple cars low price dtm package cars multiple paint schemes team versions know worthwhile include tracks package right game sort beta release candidate status depends talk consider aa final release clearly state open beta april

2093,1109,1112,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI waited til the game went free to play because of how much heat it's gotten over a certain clan.It's pretty fun and coming off World of Tanks and Warthunder, the grinding to unlock new ships as well as earning exp isn't as harsh as it is in WoT, plus I actually enjoy being able to respawn in the same game. I don't really like LTS type games. Plus with a more MOBA type of format it's been pretty easy for me to adapt to it since I play a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of Smite. The queue times aren't bad either, only took a couple seconds to enter a game when it says that the average queue time is 3 minutes or so and at the time only a handful of players were online (430).I only played two games so far and I can already tell that some ships aren't exactly in a good spot. The Conquest mode is faily easy to understand and I like how the map is layed out and is pretty much reminiscent of the standard 5v5 MOBA maps. The main reason I wanted to play this game was for the space combat and being able to use these massive ships, that part hasn't disappointed. I'm going to give it a positive review for now. It also being free to play helps it since it doesn't really offer much and only has the one mode to play. Whether it was worth $9.99 when it was still Early Access I wouldn't know.",1, early access reviewi waited til game went free play heat gotten certain clan pretty fun coming world tanks warthunder grinding unlock new ships earning exp harsh wot plus actually enjoy able respawn game like lts type games plus moba type format pretty easy adapt play metric ton smite queue times bad took couple seconds enter game says average queue time minutes time handful players online played games far tell ships exactly good spot conquest mode faily easy understand like map layed pretty reminiscent standard moba maps main reason wanted play game space combat able use massive ships disappointed going positive review free play helps offer mode play worth early access know
2094,8037,8041,Neverwinter,"Just another voice to the choir.  Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).It's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. Some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.On top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.The other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.SO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.   Once you get to the end game I would recommend you move on to something else.",0, voice choir negative review steam spot playing time leveling character likely love game recomend great combat responsive fluid quests interesting fun time play wonderful experience reach end game fun stops end game grind fest run quest repeating times end game campaigns terrible actually buy tokens zen store lets skip yes mire skip dead ring sharandar campaigns think people actually willing pay money play game insane mind character tokens account wide option spend money extra character slots try classes stuck grind fest campaigns pay tokens like cruel joke refinement system casual player friendly time play maybe hours week humanly possible way collect refinement points max level item willing spend money complain handful enchantments place weapons armor dozens new artifacts including artifact weapons equipment needing refinement level played hours day months straight able max level items yes equip character time include ones inventory switch depending tasks refinement points include reagents needed upgrade absolutely crazy way casual player going spending houndreds dollars upgrade thing aware rebalancing changes neverwinter adding new classes content required game rebalanced major update understand needed better game play mentioned items require refinement upgrade costly spend time money rebalance game discover item working longer worth effort example mod going change regeneration life steal works invested time money upgrade items buff stats choosen literally months work people time upgrade items hundreds dollars paid upgrade new player starting leveling character savior moment end game end game recommend

The game has 8 maps currently with slight changes to them instead of adding more maps a year.Barely any updates/fixes on the RTS. The RTS is what makes this game unique being able to combine a battlefield environment with a RTS map of europe making every battle you play matter for the war.Badly optimized ingame sounds(Sounds clipping and you won't hear footsteps behind you etc)Terrible squad implementation(Where it forces you play you to play in a way that doesn't make sense)Getting put on a line without tanks and equipment instead of defending the necessary line for victory.I wouldn't recommend investing time into this game.

Instead they can add new effects that no one requested(Casings going out of your gun/ Weapon has uncontrollable sway and coded inaccuracy meaning that bullets can go left or right of the target instead of CSGO where the first bullet always goes in the middle of the crosshair)They dont use a PTR system so when they make a new item (Tank/Weapon/Game mechanic) they just outwards release it breaking the current meta. Instead of removing it and fixing it they will keep it and fix it in a later build(Big builds take 3-6 months to release)Example is when they released a new faction(Soviets) with out adding a reduction to grind/free migration or any other form of buff to the new faction. Which led to the game being broken for over a year before the faction grew enough to survive. It's still broken as of today since the new faction only has 1/4 of the players of the other factions.

2142,8847,8851,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewJudging by this game's current situation, you can tell it was made by hi-rez. After having the unfortunate experience of playing this game for more than 2 rounds, you can notice a lot of things. for one thing, weapons are completely unbalanced. slug rifles, heirloom rifles, crossbow, and revolver are almost completely useless. The shotgun is also trash. the assault rifle and burst are long range and dont have damage fall off, and do more damage then they should. Another thing about this game is it's bugs. All games have them, but here they are a dime a dozen. Character glitches, map terrain errors, crashing for no reason. Now you think that by now Hi-Rez would fix this, nope. THEY ADD A BATTLE PASS! Much like Paladins, Hi-Rez is more into making dough off of small children than fixing their own god damn game. And when they do add patches, they just the problems even worse! recently they made crafting legendary weapons and crafting in general cheaper to do, so all players have equal advantage. But the thing is, players have an equal oppurtunity of getting a legendary sword and getting a legendary assault rifle.

2158,13389,13393,Creativerse,"For those who are curious about this game but don't know what its all about.  Imagine the lovechild of minecraft and planet explores (both very good games) This is a survival crafting game with a tech approach.  Very interesting concept.I bought this game when it was first released.  At the time it was buggy, incomplete had very little to do and the game environment was very plain and boring.  So I uninstalled it and forgot about it.  I don't remember how much I paid for it but I felt very disappointed in the game. I just reinstalled it yesterday and found out that the game has gone free to play.  You now have to pay a fee if you want the added features.  I wrote to the devs and asked them about the pro package and how it applied to people who backed them on release.  They replied to me within a few minutes of me posting my question in the forum.  Probably the fastest reply I have ever seen. They said anyone who bought the game would get all the pro features for free. I was delighted that I didn't have to repay for anything.  So I got back into the game and see that there are so many more features and textures and blocks to play with that they didn't have before. Unfortunately this game is still unfinished. I was disappointed that they have not yet done anything with the water biomes or created aquatic creatures.  But the rest of the game seems pretty solid.  They are lacking with the varieties of creatures you encounter and I am hoping that more will be soon to come. I think I will put this game on the back burner once again until this game is more finished.  So for right now it its current state I recommend people put it on their wishlist, and check back from time to time to see what progress the game developers have made.  But for right now i wouldn't want people to buy this game.  It has great promise but it still has more that needs to be done.

2165,11599,11603,Black Squad,"Early Access ReviewPositives---------------------------------------Black Squad is a game that has potential to become one of the better if not top f2p online fps games similar to Soldier Front 2 and Arctic Warfare...both of which no longer exist in NA. The game has multiple modes such as TDM, 8v8, and 5v5 to name a few, however this game is played mostly for the competitive 5v5 mode. Black Squad is one of the few games that has very balanced guns with the exception of a few guns of minor superiority. How is this game NOT pay2win? Well sure, there is a cash shop for ""bullet"" currency that gives you the opportunity to get a head start on the premium weapons as well as skins for the standard guns. HOWEVER! All the premium guns can be bought by ""medal"" currency which is generously given to you for, Leveling up, Daily Missions and Weekly missions making it possible to get your first premium gun such as the SR47, AK12 or 47, MDR, or the MPX by level 11 at least. The premium guns are however, harder to control and are no way similar to the superiority of the AK and M4 in CSGO. This game has(d) a fairly decent following and competitive scene in Korea as well as Indonesia and I highly recommend watching some videos of their matches to get an idea of how high the skill cap is for Black Squad as the game can be very unforgiving similar to CSGO.Negatives (CAN BE A HUGE TURN OFF FOR SOME)---------------------------------------2 Words ->Toxic CommunityIt pains me to say this, but this game suffers from some of the WORST toxicity I've ever encountered in a f2p online fps game...which is a shame because this may infact turn off a lot of players due to how prevalent it is especially in 5v5 matches. There really should be no reason for people to be so toxic, but...we all know that 95% of the online fps community is filled with 12-17 year old kids living in their parents home who get bullied at school for being a loser and want to take it out on everyone they meet in a video game...sorry not sorry. Obviously the best thing to do is to ignore them, but I apologize that ANYONE has to deal with this spoiled bahavior as it can create discomfort and lessen your enjoyment of this otherwise great game! Side note!---------------------------------------Hackers may or may not exist, but for the most part I have not had any problems with said ""hackers"" and more so find that most of my deaths are from making mistakes or getting unlucky so...take this as you will, but try to take the assumption that you need to improve and that the players are better than you rather than call them hackers and defeat yourself.

2177,4350,4354,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"I really hate Yugioh. I mean, I REALLY hate the ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's an inbalanced, unregulated piece of crap game. Watching at a 2 dollar TWO DOLLAR!!!! buy in tourney held at a kmart for local kids, saw multiple adults there (like middle aged adults, 40's) playing 500 dollar high tier competitive decks against 5 year olds learning on basic structure decks bought in store and loving themselves as they beat a 5 year old. Only one of them toned it down and help the kids learn to play. If you say ""but it's a tourney"" no, that's still not okay. I lost all respect for the game. But that all being said, no real microtransactions, teaches you the game, easy to get packs of cards (which actually limit how many of each card you get. I mean you can't get ten packs and 10 of one card and 1 of another, each pack set contains a max number of each specific card). This is a good thing for those of you who are curious. This is a thought out Yugioh digital TCG game. Even with it being Yugioh I enjoy it. I give it an 8/10.

Also the amount of expected shame from playing such a thing. It works.It succeds at being a decent clicker game. It triggers that horrible compulsive behavior that many love and or hate. There are enough mechanics to keep you actively playing if you wish.The sexy part is as expected. It does have an endless slideshow of cute anime girls, all making the noises one would expect. I suppose if I played this when I was 14 I would be turned on.

2182,13454,13458,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewSo, while I could not get the full enjoyment out of the game for my multiplayer experience, I will start off by saying this is a wonderfully designed game by appearance. The interface to create and learn recipes is great for single player experiences. Looting and interacting with the world is quite nice. Even the idea of server hosted worlds right out of the box is awesome! But that lead to my major gripe, and what ultimately lead to me ceasing to play the game with my friends. Random world resets, usually via one player crashing, are the biggest annoyance I had. After playing for about a half an hour, we would have established a nice place, storage and what not. Then at least one of us crashed. Those that did, came back to the world to see everything we built and removed from the world restored to how it was when we first found it. They could 'fly' through walls and the floor as if there was no clipping on them, only because in their game, the entire structure didn't exist anymore. If they were to extract the blocks in their way, which were part of the structure in our 'version', they would receive the material as they saw it, but we would see that crafted item be picked up, and effectively deleted due to them getting 'dirt' instead.To alleviate this, those that could see packed up the base and moved to a new location, till the issue repeated. You can only be willing to rebuild/redesign a structure so many times before you just give up. Ultimately, I assume this issue comes from world data being saved on the users pc, and not coinciding/refreshing based on the severs data. At least a debug tool which forces a refresh of currently loaded cells/chunks to be downloaded from the server would be useful until this issue is fixed. But until that time, I will await for updates and play other games. Once again, the game is amazing at what it has so far, but that issue is killer for anyone hoping for a solid multiplayer experience.",1, early access reviewso enjoyment game multiplayer experience start saying wonderfully designed game appearance interface create learn recipes great single player experiences looting interacting world nice idea server hosted worlds right box awesome lead major gripe ultimately lead ceasing play game friends random world resets usually player crashing biggest annoyance playing half hour established nice place storage crashed came world built removed world restored found fly walls floor clipping game entire structure exist anymore extract blocks way structure version receive material saw crafted item picked effectively deleted getting dirt instead alleviate packed base moved new location till issue repeated willing rebuild redesign structure times ultimately assume issue comes world data saved users pc coinciding refreshing based severs data debug tool forces refresh currently loaded cells chunks downloaded server useful issue fixed time await updates play games game amazing far issue killer hoping solid multiplayer experience

Well, let me explain:At first, you enjoy beating npcs, collecting cards from events, leveling and unlocking new characters, but when you play for months(mid game) you have to put a goal, so you go to pvp and then the trolling begins. Everybody using OP cards from the store or troll decks, it makes anyone stressed losing to someone trolling you(cyber stein, mill, burn) or someone who has the new meta deck released last week. There are a lot of boxes from the store and Konami keeps releasing every month(tons of new cards), so it makes the mid/late game an endless effort to get all the new cards and make new meta decks to get king of games or even platinum ranking.It gets very frustating to see other people spending thousand of bucks to get 3 copies of each card and when they come dueling  there goes all the fun.Also, ranking up is very hard, because even if you have a meta deck,for example, if you win 2 in a row and then lose and keeping looping that you never get promoted, most of the times you have to get 3+ wins to get something going.With all those paid to win decks no wonder you will get easily countered  in a match screwing up all your chances of getting a higher ranking, of course.Last thing to comment is if you wanna play this game, then google Cyber Angel Duel links and see how ""BALANCED"" this game is...

And it's a shame because the game could be really good if it wasn't for an unacceptable amount of non-games. More and more cards have been released with the intent to help with that issue, meanwhile we're still dealing with oversized decks, both in constructed and draft, without a proper mulligan to at least try and counter the variance brought by having that many cards in a deck. I really want to like Eternal and I can't wait for the day this review will finally change to positive, but right now I just can't. Edit: Client update recently rolled out, some UI and stability improvements, Set 4 coming up, everything looks nice... ... aaand the game still plays like a slot machine.

2200,2659,2662,War Thunder,"Indeed, even though I've got almost a 1000 hours logged (not even including the many hours playing this outside steam before it officially launched), I can't recommend War Thunder. Reason: the grind. It's horrible. It takes hundreds of hours to unlock higher tier tanks and planes, forcing you to grind or pull your wallet. The graphics are great, the gameplay is great (except for terrible balance issues) and it will hook you, but it would be better to avoid being hooked. A terrible waste of time. If the grind in the higher tiers was comparable to tiers 1/2 it would be a great game. But of course, that would mean many players will reach endgame, unlocking everything there is to unlock and potentially losing interest. Great for players, bad for Gaijin as every customer is a potential virtual opium addict, milkable of cash.It takes 1000s of dollars to unlock everything. A premium account only helps on lower tiers, you still have to grind xx-xxx hours on the highest tiers and that's the problem. Freemium isn't free. I'm all for forcing 'free to play users' to grind, but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that's clearly not the case. Spending 60 USD on a premium account + 1 vehicle unclock is but the tip of the tip of the iceberg. So even if you pay, it won't make a difference on higher tiers. The reaility is that it takes months, or weeks at 40+ hours a week using a premium account. That's just ridicilous. Got millions of convertable xp? Use it to progress faster! But pay 50 USD on top of that to be allowed to actually use it.There simply shouldn't be such a grind for paying users. Spending around 60 USD should give you a lot more bang for bucks. Paying 100 USD for a tank takes the fun away. Gaijin can do whatever they want, it's free, but the implementation is offensive to loyal, paying users. I'd happily spent my money on premium, but the difference is so small that I don't do so anymore.Every game, even those that hold a pricetag, should have a certain amount of grinding. The difference between free and premium progression is just too small to justify the price it takes to progress.",0, got hours logged including hours playing outside steam officially launched recommend war thunder reason grind horrible takes hundreds hours unlock higher tier tanks planes forcing grind pull wallet graphics great gameplay great terrible balance issues hook better avoid hooked terrible waste time grind higher tiers comparable tiers great game course mean players reach endgame unlocking unlock potentially losing interest great players bad gaijin customer potential virtual opium addict milkable cash takes dollars unlock premium account helps lower tiers grind xx xxx hours highest tiers problem freemium free forcing free play users grind spend money premium account notice huge difference clearly case spending usd premium account vehicle unclock tip tip iceberg pay wo difference higher tiers reaility takes months weeks hours week premium account ridicilous got millions convertable xp use progress faster pay usd allowed actually use simply grind paying users spending usd lot bang bucks paying usd tank takes fun away gaijin want free implementation offensive loyal paying users happily spent money premium difference small anymore game hold pricetag certain grinding difference free premium progression small justify price takes progress

Never in my life have I had to put up with so many mexicans, russians, french, Iroquoians and africans who refuse to play on their local servers and play on US West. After politely asking foreigners to speak english while on US West servers, they respond with reports, death threats and various other verbal abuses. This game has also taught me many skills in terms of raging. Never in my life have I been able to creatively use 14 swear words in 1 sentence, all because of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Riki throwing an hour and a half match by building assault cuirrass and wondering around into an enemy team.If all this game is a great game to play if you struggle with pride issues. The game's brilliant matchmaking will take 8 minutes to help you get paired up with players clearly above your league, just for the sake of getting youâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in every possible area (many you never even knew existed). Additionally, the 8 minute matchmaking system will also pair you with downies, russians, autists and Josh Elliot, who will all most likely blame their 20 minute loss on you. Oh, also before I forget, there is a lack of a surrender button so you if things goâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥up for your team, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, you have to sit through an hour of watching the entire enemy team snowball, and if they want to prolong the game by not pushing when they can, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, you have to sit through it. Of course, there is a way to skip this, and that is by abandoning. After abandoning a match, you will play in a low priority pool for X amount of games.

2215,4497,4501,SMITE®,"Note: Most of the hours I've accumulated in the game occured during the latter half of SMITE Season 3.This game is like Monopoly: a game usually played in large groups with friends and family, takes some time to learn the rules, requires a lot of compromise with others, and -- a big point --- is known to destroy the bonds between others. This ""Monopoly"" has a few different flavors, though Official Rules [Conquest] is the main rule set that you have to go by, since the game's balancing is solely based upon it. This way of playing takes the longest on average: 3 lanes, 5v5, jungle, in typical MOBA fashion. Notoriously has been avoided due to the seriousness/salt associated with the mode, but with the evergrowing playerbase being introduced to the game via ads or the SPL, this game mode follows the ""stomp or be stomped"" motto.Every other mode is off of the vanilla version, and the best mode of them all, in my opinion, is either Quick Play [Siege, a two-lane, 4v4 mode, with a ""ticket"" counter which releases a big bad boy after you get 100 tickets... or until the big bad spawns in the center jungle; pub-stompy as hell, but a ton of fun when the teams are of equal skill; full party, or two-man queue, required] or Family Rules [Assault, an all-random, all-mid, 5v5 mode, but with no ""passing go"", no backing; you kill until you die, then you get to collect your rent].Arena, a 5v5 free-for-all with a ticket system, has two goals: bait the enemy team so they can foolishly have a wave of minions go into their portal [and deduct tickets en masse], or sit in front of your portal as the only tank and clear minions for 5 minutes as your carries aggressively 1v3+ despite the fact that you knowingly recalled. This is the mode that you're supposed to start off on. This is basically Monopoly Empires, or Minions Monopoly: it has a simple ruleset, so it's good for newcomers. Definitely not my favorite mode due to the amount of cheese comps flourish. Literally a mode built for one-combo wonders.Joust, a 3v3, one lane, game mode, used to be my favorite, as it felt fairly balanced in comparison to the other modes. By balanced, I meant the perfect amounts of salt and mechanics. In the former half of Season 4, the only safe Joust was a Ranked Joust; in the latter half, the only safe Joust is a Bots Joust. Clash, a 5v5, two lane, game mode, has always been my least favorite, because, in Season 3, there were too many objectives to keep tabs on [literally had two Conquest objectives slapped inside the mode with no care], and in the beginning of Season 4 [some claim that it still exists, others do not], the snowball was so catastrophic that people died from the resulting avalanche.The game's itemization, balancing due to items, and overtuned god releases has left me --and many others-- tired and on-edge. It took one and a half years to say goodbye to this game, though 4+ months of that time was a hiatus. I knew it was time to stop playing so frequently when I resorted to spamming the Voice-Guided System [VGS] during a match where my ADC was needlessly aggressive early game against an early game-oriented team... and I actually resorted to taunt-spam near the mid/late game despite knowing the enemy team suffers in the late game. That happened months ago, when I was solo-queueing a game and went against a full party with two other solo-queuers.I'm typically a pacifist, a humble person when it comes to video games -- not opting to play overly-aggressive unless I know that it'll lead to a kill, making sure my team knows the game plan, warding when necessary, etc. I mained the Support role, despite starting off in the game playing Mages and high-skillfloor Hunters. I swapped around roles after a while, testing out every character there is to play, and it was legitimately fun. I'm sitting at 90 Mastered Deities [out of 92, as of this post] and three Diamonds [Khepri, Sobek, and Skadi]; my distaste for the game started to settle in while I was in the late 70s, if not earlier. Near the end of my ""reign"", I played more aggressive, with limited callouts, no warding, etc., because it didn't feel as though I needed to, since my team ""wouldn't listen to me"" regardless.This game will keep you preoccupied for a while, and you will have fun playing it, so long as you play the characters the meta heavily favors, stay in bot matches, or play in premades [full parties for the gamemode] and hope MMR bones the enemy team. Playing a spicy character that is unfavorable in the meta, like a Zhonger Donger or a Kuzenbro, is basically death, either to BM or to your own self-loathing. I would probably wait out on the game for another few months, because the game's current state is why I've given up on the game entirely, and I'm 95% sure that my leave will be permanent.Season 5 is coming, and the team at Hi-Rez Studios is trying its hardest to get the game back to a healthy state. Unfortunately, those promises fall to my deaf ears; many chances were given, and it was the last straw. I await the day where they release a premium-priced game that isn't strictly-online, because the amount of love and attention the design team puts into the game is probably what kept me playing for as long as I had.P.S.: The Adventures modes, aside from the crappy Corrupted Arena one, were pretty great [even if they had their own share of bugs], so here's hoping that those elevator pitches turn into legitimate games.

2220,8301,8305,Neverwinter,"Downloaded the game 3 days ago, and now I have 30+ hours of playtime on Neverwinter. It's THAT addictive.The game is great! Lots of people, a good questing system, etc. Many agree that this game is amazing, but there are some cons despite what the community and players tell you. Based on what I have found on my 30 hours of gameplay, let me show you my pros/cons.Important Notes:-This game is not P2W like many say, you can go along fine playing for free, just steer clear of the PvP arena, the P2W players will be there.-Game is in english...Pros:-Great questing system, and trackfinder.-Combat is great!-Lots of people always online, you'll probably never go into an instance and find that you're the only one there.-Lots of content-Amazing graphics for a free game, can lower/higher at will.-Engaging.-Can spend HOURS on this game and not get bored.-Many dungeons, can spend hours playing with friends in a dungeon and have a great time there.-There's a bit of secret bosses, places, etc you can find in a dungeon.Cons:-You can only get 1 basic mount, then you'd have to either wait till an event comes or buy it with zen.-Astral Diamonds --> Zen is at a very low exchange rate.-Lots of stuff in the game, the AD and Zen are overpriced.-Mods speak in a different language than english. (For all you englishmen)-The damn dropboxes get annoying, you get the same thingo over and over again, and you can't open it without zen.Summary:The game's great for first-time RPG players to try and get a taste of things, and you could really have fun in this game. But to achieve true potential of this game, you'd need to grab a few bucks out of your wallet to really make your character stand a chance in those PvP arenas.

2221,10803,10807,Eternal Card Game,"Eternal is a... pretty good game? I guess. But it's also... not a good game? Maybe? And I think my overall opinion of it falls more on the 'not a good game'-side than on the 'yes a good game'-side. I'll try to explain.I enjoy Eternal a lot when I'm building my decks, it scratches that itch in the same way that I used to spend hours constructing decks back when I played Mtg (like... late 90's? So 20 years ago. Jesus.). It's just great figuring out synergies and perfecting strategies, building that engine, and to see -to know!- how everything fits together. So good. And it is genuinely thrilling when you try out your deck and you see the engine work and power the machine that you've built, steamrolling the opposition. (So, turns out, the machine you built was a steamroller.)So so good.And sure, as noted in other reviews, as far as Free-to-play games go, Eternal is pretty generous. I mean, it's a bit grindy, but all-in-all you can earn the currencies needed to support your card-buying addiction.Another thing I enjoy about Eternal is that, because it's fully digital and never meant to be published as a table-top game, they can really play around with the card effects. I have never played Hearthstone, so I don't know how much of a rip-off all of this is, but I do love the fact that cards in your hand or in your deck can get altered for the rest of the match. I really like how the game can make doubles of a card or how it conjures up a card that isn't even in your deck, because it can do all of that because nothing is physical. I guess that might be a small thing to some, but I do enjoy the inventiveness that went into those mechanisms.But. But but but.We have come to the part of why I'm not actually recommending Eternal.You see, the thing is that most of the time, when you're dueling, it feels like you're playing two opponents instead of just the one: There's the person or AI that you're trying to defeat, as you do, and then there's the terrible ""random"" card draw generator. The card draw generator (most colloquially called the RNG around these here parts) is oftentimes completely baffling in how it works. Or doesn't work. It will -quite cheerfully, I'm convinced- more times than should be possible give you the worst hand you can imagine. It will either NOT give you the power cards (so, Mana) that you so desperately need or it will give you -and continue giving you- more power cards than you can ever hope to need (denying you a card that you could otherwise really use right about now).It's pretty bad when you're playing a human (and when my human opponent suffers from it, I feel like my eventual win was not deserved in the slightest) but it's even worse when playing an AI. The AI opponents, of course, never have this problem.So when you build your deck, you've not only got to think about what your opponent might throw at you and try to plan for that, but you also have to plan for when and how the card draw will gimp you. Fun.As an aside, there's probably some confirmation bias and false pattern-recognition going on here, but I've also noticed that the RNG will often give you one type of card in clumps. If you have 2 copies of the same card in your deck of 75 cards, there's a high chance that you'll draw both in a short amount of time. And sure, you usually have multiple copies of cards in the deck so getting a few of the same cards during one game isn't so weird, right? Except it happens a LOT that you just draw the same cards over and over again, so much so that sometimes I forget I had a certain card in my deck until 8, 9, 10 games in I'll suddenly draw it and go: ""Huh, right, there's 4 copies of this card in there, too."" It's especially aggravating when you're literally only drawing weapons or buffs to cast on creatures, but not the creatures themselves.This is just to say that losing because you got shafted in what cards you draw (or don't draw) is the worst. I don't mind losing to a more skilled opponent, but around 90% of my losses is because the card draw generator hates me (and quite cheerfully so, like I said). It's very very frustrating.It's so frustrating, in fact, that for this reason alone, I do not recommend Eternal.(I mean, there's other smaller reasons. The game is technically Pay-to-win and the Meta is pretty annoying, to give two examples. You quickly learn to recognize the decks that everyone is playing and have been copying off each other or the Eternal Warcry site. And it's no fun playing against someone who drops legendary after legendary card because they had either too much money to spend or more patience to grind than you do. All in all, these are more minor quibbles and don't really kill the game for me.)So that's basically why I'm rating the game negatively. Below is small rant that probably no one should read because I get a little bit salty and I realize this review is already too long, so suffice to say that in general these were my thoughts. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.-----RantNow, the Direwolf people might reply to this review with the following (as they have been doing for quite a lot of negative reviews): ""The power system is an important and strategic part of Eternal; if you're having trouble with it, there are lots of tools and techniques that can mitigate this (like adding power-searching cards like Seek Power to your deck, adding more card draw, or finding ways to discard excess Sigils).""This is mostly bull shirt. I would definitely not say there are ""LOTS of tools and techniques that can mitigate this"". Taking a mulligan on your initial draw is useless if the RNG still doesn't give you the power cards that you need (or if it suddenly gives you too many). Seek Power? Oh yes, great card. It's definitely not a waste of a round and a slot in your deck that you could have given to a better card. Pledge? Get out of here. Adding card draw? That seriously depends on which factions you play. I guess Nightfall is pretty cool, but oh wait, that's also only for certain factions.All of this would be moot if drawing power cards was somehow balanced. The game is so inventive and does so many cool things in the digital space, but for some reason they can't program the RNG to give you a power card after not getting one for the 5th, 6th, 7th time in a row when it's clear you're forking struggling to get anything on the board. Or maybe a simple mechanic could be included where you can pass and do nothing that round and get a guaranteed power card next round. Or maybe the amount of power cards you draw in your initial hand could be a fixed amount for everyone. Seriously, it can't be that hard. But no no, ""the power system is an important and strategic part of Eternal."" Sheesh.And the funniest part of it is that in a real-life tabletop card game, the card draw would never cheat you like that, ever. So I don't know, maybe I should go back to playing Mtg in my FLGS? Probably not though.",0, eternal pretty good game guess good game maybe think overall opinion falls good yes good try explain enjoy eternal lot building decks scratches itch way spend hours constructing decks played mtg like late years ago jesus great figuring synergies perfecting strategies building engine fits good genuinely thrilling try deck engine work power machine built steamrolling opposition turns machine built good sure noted reviews far free play games eternal pretty generous mean bit grindy earn currencies needed support card buying addiction thing enjoy eternal fully digital meant published table game play card effects played hearthstone know rip love fact cards hand deck altered rest match like game doubles card conjures card deck physical guess small thing enjoy inventiveness went mechanisms come actually recommending eternal thing time dueling feels like playing opponents instead person ai trying defeat terrible random card draw generator card draw generator colloquially called rng parts oftentimes completely baffling works work cheerfully times possible worst hand imagine power cards mana desperately need continue giving power cards hope need denying card use right pretty bad playing human human opponent suffers feel like eventual win deserved slightest worse playing ai ai opponents course problem build deck got think opponent throw try plan plan card draw gimp fun aside probably confirmation bias false pattern recognition going noticed rng type card clumps copies card deck cards high chance draw short time sure usually multiple copies cards deck getting cards game weird right happens lot draw cards forget certain card deck games suddenly draw huh right copies card especially aggravating literally drawing weapons buffs cast creatures creatures losing got shafted cards draw draw worst mind losing skilled opponent losses card draw generator hates cheerfully like said frustrating frustrating fact reason recommend mean smaller reasons game technically pay win meta pretty annoying examples quickly learn recognize decks playing copying eternal warcry site fun playing drops legendary legendary card money spend patience grind minor quibbles kill game basically rating game negatively small rant probably read little bit salty realize review long suffice general thoughts thank coming ted direwolf people reply review following lot negative reviews power system important strategic eternal having trouble lots tools techniques mitigate like adding power searching cards like seek power deck adding card draw finding ways discard excess bull shirt definitely lots tools techniques mitigate taking mulligan initial draw useless rng power cards need suddenly gives seek power oh yes great card definitely waste round slot deck given better card pledge adding card draw seriously depends factions play guess nightfall pretty cool oh wait certain factions moot drawing power cards balanced game inventive cool things digital space reason program rng power card getting time row clear forking struggling board maybe simple mechanic included pass round guaranteed power card round maybe power cards draw initial hand fixed seriously hard power system important strategic eternal sheesh funniest real life tabletop card game card draw cheat like know maybe playing mtg flgs probably

2224,13341,13345,Creativerse,"I was on the fence about tryng this game which does not make any sense since it's free. I felt like it would be a demo deal where you pay to unlock content but that is not the case. The only things I have seen that you can pay for are already available in the world where you just pay for minor convienence or for asthetic stuff or things that are cool but completely unneccesary.I have never played Minecraft so I don't know how it compares other than the fact that I'm not willing to plunk down the money to try Minecraft.There are two things I really like about this game other than the explore/expand and sandbox aspects:The first thing I like is that you must constantly protect yourself which makes the game very immersive. At nightfall things become a bit more dangerous than during the day so your base and it's security are very important. It also makes exploring challenging since you must decide to fight on through the night or set up a temporary camp. You will find yourself underpressure to use what you have available to quickly build shelter, and waiting for daybreak (there will be lots to do while in your base so you will not be idle) to gather more resources and improve your base. I find myself constantly racing against the clock and taking incremental improvement where I can.The second thing I like is just how massive the world is. It will take you a very long time to get from one end of the map to the other, and I'm not sure how long it would take to explore the whole map but not the amout of time I have with a full time job. For me this makes this game have a long burn rate which is really important for me since I get bored quickly with games.There are many other good things about this game but it just boils down to the fact that it is a well thought through game with a lot of content and endless possibilities. Not something I would expect from a free to play game. I enjoy this as much as I enjoy RunesScape and EVE Online but both those games have extremely limited free to play versions (which is fine, the idea is if you like it then pay for it), very unlike this game.I think there could be more documentation but as of writing this the game is very new. I'm also more a fan of user generated documentation than manuals/tutorias so this will improve with time.",1, fence tryng game sense free felt like demo deal pay unlock content case things seen pay available world pay minor convienence asthetic stuff things cool completely unneccesary played minecraft know compares fact willing plunk money try minecraft things like game explore expand sandbox aspects thing like constantly protect makes game immersive nightfall things bit dangerous day base security important makes exploring challenging decide fight night set temporary camp find underpressure use available quickly build shelter waiting daybreak lots base idle gather resources improve base find constantly racing clock taking incremental improvement second thing like massive world long time end map sure long explore map amout time time job makes game long burn rate important bored quickly games good things game boils fact thought game lot content endless possibilities expect free play game enjoy enjoy runesscape eve online games extremely limited free play versions fine idea like pay unlike game think documentation writing game new fan user generated documentation manuals tutorias improve time

2248,1590,1593,Fractured Space,"Early Access Review:TL;DR - its a fun, well built moba, with room for more maps and ships to keep people interested. currently there is only the 1 map, but it is solid. (kinda like Rift is to LoL)PROs: -Leaning the roll of your ship means you have a better idea of how to engage/not engage nme fleets (as a Raider i now know how to reliably kill a colossus 1v1, as a protector, i know is suicide to 1v1 anything other than a sniper. the Venture is a very strong defencive ship and a great starter.)-just because you are hidiously out tonned doesnt mean you are helpless, it just means you have a significantly less forgiving fleet that needs to fight smart to win. play the death timers. DONT DIE.-The map is crazy fun once you understand how it works and how to navagate it.-jumping = hidiously vulnarable, knowing when to jump is critical to winning. (more so when you play big slow ships like the colossus, destroyer, gladiator, or leviathan.)-Gamma Buff is a game ending mechanic to keep games short, Gamma 3+ allows the holders to jump streight to the enemy base, IN ADDITION to the normal buff goodness. If you ignored Gamma 1-2, you can NOT ignore Gamma 3 without serious consiquence.-Lots of incentives to login daily and play games - free stuff is rarely a bad thing.CONs: -what the hell are upgrades?! (ANS: it's your ship leveling up after your team gains resources for those bases you cap'd that send out mining tugs that you maybe have been destroying. upgrades are automatic once you go back to/capture a base that you could 'heal' from; you will notice your hp max has gone up. at lv3,6,9 you can pick a major upgrade to your ship (B) damage + RoF, (N) defence, hp, armor up, and (?) utility... #notasupport-looks like a rip off of Dreadnaught (which im really anxious to play..) but whatever, right?(ANS: now that Dreadnaught is mostly out, they are NOTHING alike. This is more like League of Legends.)-no real balance between the factions.. (ANS: but that doesnt matter because 'factions' dont actually matter in game, they are just 'flavor groups' each has their 'hard to play ships' and ones that you will fall in love with...)HOW TO PLAY...-Jumps: jumps have a fairly long delay (jump prep) before going off. 'jump home' is about 2-3sec longer than the normal 'jump' and has a MUCH longer cooldown. while in 'jump prep' you take a bazillion times more damage, so getting shot while jumping is bad and will ususally kill you.-Death Timers: dont get caught at one of the enemy forward bases when they are ready to respawn. watch the map; getting dunked by the nme team for trying to take the base isnt worth it.-Gamma: not 100% necessary before Gamma3, after that, the game is basically in a slower 'sudden death' as every ship WITH THE BUFF can jump to the nme base and has a CAP RATE BUFF.-Team Fighting: FOCUS THE DAMAGE or THE HEALER. if you are fighting for gamma things like the Raven, Enforcer, Ghost, Furion, Brawler, Interceptor, NEED TO DIE ASAP or you wont have a team left.-Positioning: USE TERRAIN. If you arent the tank, let the tank be first in, then, SUPPORT THE TANK by killing their damage first. Terrain will save you when you are low hp, have swarms of missiles incomming, or an angery Lev that wants to lazor you off the map. Mines are also good hidey spots for a quick jump home to rep.PRIORITIZE FLYING WHERE YOU NEED TO GO OVER SHOOTING PPL UNLESS YOU CAN WIN. flying into a rock because you were in a fight with an interceptor and are now loosing is a great way to get wrecked.USE YOUR FORWARD BASES. they heal you. fighting while being healed gives you a pretty big advantage. plus there is a giant los blocking shield you can pop up from behind! KNOW YOUR OPTIMAL RANGES - just because you CAN shoot, doesnt mean you should. ALWAYS consider your range with high damage shots like those from the Raven, Interceptor, Centurion, and Leviathan, you go from doing a few hundred damage to a few thousand.. kinda important.Rocket weapons (ghost, pioneer, overseer, watchman, guardian), and all smart guns, have no optimal range, only a max range.JUMP HOME. '6' sends you home. it takes longer to charge than a normal jump, but it doesnt need you to open a menu. additionally, if you jump home you STILL HAVE YOUR NORMAL JUMP to IMMEDIATLY go some place else.POSITIONING IS KEY.-Cloaking.. detection will only mess you up if you are cloaked when it goes off. being cloaked and moving will use energy. not moving while cloaked will let it recharge. entering enemy controlled capture zones (bases/mines) will decloak you. you need to be fully decloaked to contribute to capture and to heal at bases. YOU CAN JUMP CLOAKED.-The Enemy Base: it has 3 turret generators each side, just being in the capture area will let you contribute to capturing it - this will decloak you. once you are in the enemy base zone to can linger outside the capture area, this can be a HUGE headache for the nme. even after they have recaped their forward bases. killing off the base turret gen's means less passive damage for your team which is particularly nice for your healer who generally cant self-rep (Superlifter CAN self-heal and is OP because of this).CARRYING..Use your team. your AI is garbage in some ships. new players are garbage in most ships. this can be mitigated by pointing out the things that Must die, either by ping, chat, and or shooting at the target. Dont rage, play smart, support your team on pushes, dont try to solo cap the nme base when gamma is up. win gamma. win the game.Carry Ships: generally range is your friend. -Heavies suffer from a lack of mobility but can help anchor your team in fights for base or gamma. IMO the Ageis is pretty solid with its speed, hp, smart gun, and team wrecker, it suffers at close range and from the Basilisk.-Mediums are your bread and butter. do the damage, make the enemy team disappear so yours can win. you gotta know target priority, LoS, and how not to get focused. Interceptor and Furion are scary dps ships.-Lights and Supports have a couple issues, biggest: their lack of hp makes them unforgiving if you get focused. secondly, damage vs reps.. reps are limited, damage is significantly less so. A well played Superlifter or Protector can be VERY strong, but if your team starts to really fall appart you have very little to counter with. Raider and Raven are VERY powerful damage boats, and can 1v1 most things, this means you can hold a base while your team recovers; downside is both revolve around 1 ability which isnt always up.Now..3ker's Guild to Ships:...(see comments)",1, early access review fun built moba room maps ships people interested currently map solid kinda like rift roll ship means better idea engage engage nme fleets raider know reliably kill colossus protector know suicide sniper venture strong defencive ship great hidiously tonned nt mean helpless means significantly forgiving fleet needs fight smart win play death timers dont map crazy fun understand works navagate hidiously vulnarable knowing jump critical winning play big slow ships like colossus destroyer gladiator buff game ending mechanic games short gamma allows holders jump streight enemy base addition normal buff goodness ignored gamma ignore gamma incentives login daily play games free stuff rarely bad thing cons hell upgrades ans ship leveling team gains resources bases send mining tugs maybe destroying upgrades automatic capture base heal notice hp max gone pick major upgrade ship b damage rof n defence hp armor utility notasupport looks like rip dreadnaught m anxious play dreadnaught alike like league real balance factions ans nt matter factions nt actually matter game flavor groups hard play ships ones fall love play jumps fairly long delay jump prep going jump home longer normal jump longer cooldown jump prep bazillion times damage getting shot jumping bad ususally kill timers nt caught enemy forward bases ready respawn watch map getting dunked nme team trying base nt worth necessary game basically slower sudden death ship buff jump nme base cap rate fighting focus damage healer fighting gamma things like raven enforcer ghost furion brawler interceptor need die asap wo nt team use terrain nt tank let tank support tank killing damage terrain save low hp swarms missiles incomming angery lev wants lazor map mines good hidey spots quick jump home rep prioritize flying need shooting ppl win flying rock fight interceptor loosing great way wrecked use forward bases heal fighting healed gives pretty big advantage plus giant los blocking shield pop know optimal ranges shoot nt mean consider range high damage shots like raven interceptor centurion leviathan damage thousand kinda important rocket weapons ghost pioneer overseer watchman guardian smart guns optimal range max range jump home sends home takes longer charge normal jump nt need open menu additionally jump home normal jump immediatly place positioning detection mess cloaked goes cloaked moving use energy moving cloaked let recharge entering enemy controlled capture zones bases mines decloak need fully decloaked contribute capture heal bases jump enemy base turret generators capture area let contribute capturing decloak enemy base zone linger outside capture area huge headache nme recaped forward bases killing base turret gen means passive damage team particularly nice healer generally nt self rep superlifter self heal op use team ai garbage ships new players garbage ships mitigated pointing things die ping chat shooting target nt rage play smart support team pushes nt try solo cap nme base gamma win gamma win game carry ships generally range friend suffer lack mobility help anchor team fights base gamma imo ageis pretty solid speed hp smart gun team wrecker suffers close range bread butter damage enemy team disappear win got ta know target priority los focused interceptor furion scary dps supports couple issues biggest lack hp makes unforgiving focused secondly damage vs reps reps limited damage significantly played superlifter protector strong team starts fall appart little counter raider raven powerful damage boats things means hold base team recovers downside revolve ability nt guild comments

2250,3820,3823,Team Fortress 2,"Gaben has singlehandedly sucked my social life and my bank savings out of me with this one ""free to play"" game. Well played, Valve. But, still, there are plenty of good things to say about this game. It's certainly one of the few with the more pleasant communities that I've run into, and for every script kiddie or unpleasant player, there are plenty more humourous and amusing ones just here to have some lighthearted fun. With an audience that seems to be made of older teens up to early twenties, with some younger kids sprinkled in, the community still manages to be friendly and open. Mostly, anyway. You'll meet an aimbot or a more hostile player in a few here and there, but what community doesn't have those. TF2 is considerably nicer than some gaming communities I've been around.The competitive scene is lacking, and while the TF2 team is making an effort to put some emphasis on comp, pubs remain the larger attraction for many new and old players alike, leaving TF2 players who are interested in playing competitively, unfortunately, high and dry. These players have to go to third-party sources for opportunities to play in competitive modes such as 6s and Highlander. Valve desperately needs to provide a competitive mode similar to these two forms of competitive TF2, or perhaps a non-competitive option that allows players to practise 6s / Highlander. Their comp mode is much improved now compared to what it was a few months ago, but it certainly is still lacking.Though there are only nine playable classes, there is always something new to touch upon or some skill to learn and master. TF2 provides an abundance of weapons that are obtainable through crafting, trading, drops, or purchases. The large range of weapons definitely give classes more options, more opportunity to vary playstyle, and endless creativity when it comes to how they take on a game or counter an enemy team.Some classes can definitely be fixed/improved upon, such as the pyro (many of whom seem to know only one playstyle: the W+M1 'meta'), and there can definitely be changes made. However, I understand the delay in doing so, as balancing/changing a single class can have profound impact on the rest of the classes and the game.Overall, a very fine product that remains fun to play and always leaves room for learning despite only having nine classes, and one that has a relatively welcoming and fun community. It's not a surprise to see that TF2 is a game that's thriving after more than 10 years.

I could tell right off the bat in the tutorial missions that mana would be a huge frustration. And I was right.There is a reason the most popular card games on the planet don't use mana cards. Mana cards suck. They suck alot.Game after game you will either be begging to draw more mana, or begging to stop drawing so much mana. You will be frustrated almost every single game, and it marrs the entire experience. The cards are awesome and the game has a fantastic overall design, and it's almost utterly ruined by mana cards.It's an outdated and terrible mechanic.

2262,4700,4704,SMITE®,"This game really surprised me. Oh, the splendor.I was an avid Dota and Heroes of Newerth player for many years. This game has blown me away.It is very well made. In fact, everything about this game is well constructed: it has thorough tutorials and tutorial videos in-game... AND you can even play against Bots/AI with friends co-op online and earn points to unlock characters etc. while you're learning to play the game. (It is genuinely FREE to play if that's the route you want to take. There are no unbalanced in-game features for paying money, unlike games such as League of Legends)Once you play a MOBA with a 3rd Person view-point, you wonder why this isn't the gaming standard for the genre right now. That being said Smite is still madly popular, and for a reason. The people who dislike this type of game are generally people who jump right into public play without practicing against AI first, or without learning the classes/roles that synergize together. The Smite community is also WAY less toxic than other MOBAs that i've played and that, is a plus!If you're into the idea of playing as mythical gods from cultures around the world, and you are looking for a revolutionary MOBA experience in 3rd Person ... the game will not disappoint! It's ****ing good. Try it out.(The only thing I will recommend is that you practice a bunch against AI on Medium and learn about the different player roles before jumping into public Conquest matches.

You guys compleatly ditched what everyone was telling you guys to do and went with a youtubers advice. And another thing although i dont personally like late game the balloon chipper was the only way to get crazy late game. And another thing i wanna say is blaze it comleatly gave you guys all the files to his modded server (all the towers were viable and were all balanced) and you guys didnt even care about it and went with with super jom bombo. I understand you made this change to make people use other towers, But you cant compleatly destroy a tower combo that was the only way to defend round 13 rushes and more. Another thing is this game is compleatly pay to win. Theres literally a way to pay to be #1 on leaderboard (it would take a lot of money but its possible). Another thing is you guys were trying to make other towers viable but i will tell you guys exactly how to do that, just buff other towers. Simple.

2266,6604,6608,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access Reviewso where do i start? First off the game looks great for whatever engine it is running, it is also understandable that the game is in beta/early access and a lot will still be implemented... I am giving this a thumbs down for now since it is far from being finished and the fact that the cons outweight the pros...try the game out. im pretty sure you will love it up until you pass level 3 and/or encounter these issues more and more...Pros :If you are looking for that WWII feel, one where you and your buddies can feel as if you are part of the inglorious bastards, or part of the team of FURY then this game will most likely put you on the right path, it has nice maps and i feel they are made nicely and seem pretty balance where no other team will dominate simply because its better for them starting on whatever side of the map they are...  Sadly that is the only Pro for this game so far...Cons:PAY PAY PAY... although it is possible to get pretty much anything with the ingame currency you will have to force yourself to grind grind and grind some more just to get that upgrade. (note the higher you rank up the more credits you get). like every P2W game anyone with the cash to blow will always out power you. The slow climb to power (weapons and vehicules) will always leave you on a disadvantage...Balance is so far an EHH factor since 7 out of 10 matches i played one team out number the other with tanks and planes, which results to a quick end game, fastest round i played so far from start to finish was 3 mins.Dont expect to be able to upgrade your weapon like you would in todays FPS games, there is no scope attachments or suppressors, but you can upgrade the triggers, barrels and so on (the little things) YOU ARE STUCK WITH IRON SIGHTS!!!! until you unlock the sniper rifle, which you can get once you reached the RECON class, which is some way away and would take anyone some time to get unless you pay with real money. same goes with the upgrades... You will forced to bus the Veteran pack membership if you want to level up faster which costs 2400 gold that you have to pay for with real money and there is no option to buy that much gold so you are forced to buy more gold than you need, which is about 4700 gold for 19.95 Euros below that it is 2200 gold for 9.95 euros...The hit boxes and damage effects is another thing thats messed up at the moment... for example i snuck up behind a tank to place these Anti Tank grenades on it, for some reason the gunner saw me, how? i dont know since the pilot and gunner have a very minimal point of view (dont think Battlefield when i say limited i mean you can look a few degrees to the left and right, and see next to nothing since the scopes you look through is way to dark, makes you wish for night vision) anyway then the gunner jumps out and starts shooting at me, at this point i already places the ATG on him so i ran for cover, as i reach my cover i turn around to see the gunner standing right next to the tank and i watch the tank explode in a massive explosion and i watched the gunner just stand there in the brunt of the explosion with not a care in the world and just kills me with one shot (note i had full health)...Damage, like ive mention above this seems to be off by i dont know how many factors, forget the invinsible tank gunner for a second and lets go to the weapon damage, you start with the standard rilfes of each faction, The US using the M1Grand, Germany  Gewher 43 and the Russians the SVT40... then you get a sniper riles one unscoped and one with a scope (scoped can only be purcashed once you reach RECON CLASS or with REAL MONEY). now damage can be upgraded by upgrading your weapon like the Trigger, Barrel, Sights, Ammo and Internals which is the bolt or spring... I have the russian sniper rifle which is the Mosin-Nagant 1891 upgraded for maximum damage and for some reason it still take more than 2 shots most of the time to kill someone, which others seem to be getting one hit kills by shooting you on the leg while you have full HP... Could be hacks or could be there is something that i am missing? who knows..Objects have rough edges there are countless times where i find my weapon aimed perfectly at someone and clearly nothing in the way of my weapon and ones i shoot POOF invisible wall saves his life... Example i saw a guy proning about 50 meters from me. which is an easy kill, he was looking my way but was busy shooting at someone else, i had a perfcet shot on his head since he was proned and it was the only thing i could see of his body, so i lined up my shot places my sights right on his head and took the shot, and of course invisible wall saves his life. so i line up again to take another shot since he didnt see me yet. i fired, and yup you guessed it invisible wall again, so i move a little to the left *note he is on higher ground so all i can see is his head and it is the only thing i can hit, so standing a little to the left now i took another shot at his head, but instead of killing him (with my maxed out damage upgraded scopeless sniper rifle) all it did was damage him even though i had a pefect shot at his head). He saw me as a result of this shot so i take cover behind a boulder and started to reload my weapon the all of a sudden bang i get hit with a headshot, so im like F**k someone was behind me. buuuut noooo it was the same guy according to the killcam... and this has happened a bunch of time on different matches and maps... latency issues? hacks? unsmooth edges? who knows... There have been an extreme amout of BS deaths that just makes you stop and wonder like WTF HOW? but then you just stop and think the game is still in BETA and there will be issues, but once it happens often you just stop and think ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!! the game is still good though if you have friends to play it with, i wont recommend it if you want to play it alone at the state it is now, you will just spend most of your time wondering how the F**K did he manage to kill me like that or how the F**k did i manage to do that...Jumping in the game is also broken, most of the time the command does not even respond and when it does you will feel as if you are playing Counter Strike with gravity off, you jump high and it takes you a while to get back down, ive gotten a bunch of kills like this, it makes for easy targets...Match Making is also another headache, which results in unbalance like mention above. if you make a squad you are stuck on the squad page, so everytime you want to make a change or an upgrade you will have to leave the squad and make your changes and get reinvited back in... a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you are the squad leader...If you leave a game you have a lock out of a few mins from the looks of it, kind of like in NOSGOTH...All in all the game is good aside for these things which kills the fun to be honest but the game is still Beta and i will stick around to see the finished product, but for now it gets a thumbs down until these issues are resolved.Including the unbalance, this game is reall really really bad when it comes to balance, there are no words for how unbalanced this game it... i fly Russia, and ive never been in a single round where there were more than 3 pilots on my side, worst balance i ever had was 3 pilots vs 11... 11!!!

2275,2550,2553,War Thunder,"Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on ""their data"" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins ""data"" says they do ""perfectly fine"" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible ""data"" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of ""Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!"" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result.

Whoops.I may sound like an old war vet, but Planetside 1 had a lot of nice features that people refer to as ""meta-game"" that Planetside 2 seems to be missing.PS2 is a perpetual war: three distinct factions with their own pros and cons are fighting over the planet of Auraxis and its many continents. What's the end goal? ♥♥♥♥ me if I know. The continents are filled with many bases and outposts that you must take with your faction. When you take that, you move on to the next, and the next, and the next... and eventually the enemy starts pushing back and you lose all those bases you just captured. It's one giant tug of war with no end. Even if you take every possible base on a continent, the enemy factions have permanent footholds on each continent, so they can just push right back with no reprocussions. PS1 had more than three continents and each faction had one permanent sanctuary on another island rather than footholds on each landmass.There may be about 50+ bases in the game but it feels like there's only about 5-10 different base designs. Even though this game is still under constant development and base design changes are made often, they still feel like a patch job rather than a permanent solution... but to be fair, the original only had about 1 with very minor changes in between, but still...However - PS2, as a free to play FPS, is very good. (especially after the optimization update!) The community is also really great, and I reccomend finding a good outfit to play with for the best possible experience with this game. There's nothing like joining a squad of other players to give the push you need to get to that second base, or to that one point, or even to own the skies and destroy the ground.  The MMO of this MMOFPS really shines here. You can sometimes even join a group of random people and use the ingame VoIP to really get♥♥♥♥♥♥done with perfect strangers who just happen to wear the same colors as you.If you're wondering about the ability to pay for things, it's a bit all over the board, but mostly good.

2280,7520,7524,Trove,"Here's the short of it.""Was"" (in some aspects still is) a Good game with a lot of ways to kill time with friends, but now its all about the $$$. Oh, you are new? ♥♥♥♥ you, pay me!Here's the long.The reason I cannot reccomend it anymore (mostly for new players) is because of changes made to the game around the time of this review. Classes in game can no longer be unocked with cubits (currency earned from grinding). Instead classes must be purchased with money, which is going to affect new players the most since they will be stuck playing out as a single class, which for their sake I hope they chose wisely. Mabey if they like the game enough they will buy a new class, but it will be hard to enjoy a game where you are stuck using something you regret choosing, no? If you have enough in game resources, you can buy a class coin (unlocks one character) for a hefty fee from another player. New players wont be able to afford these class coins. Another thing that has changed is the acquisition of dragons. The update was supposed ""to make getting a dragon easier"", lies. It is now more difficult to get a dragon as they must be crafted with a hefty(er) amount of resources, unless you would like to pay money to make things feasible.  I understand that running a F2P online game takes money, what i cannot stand is when corporate does not come out with the truth behind decisions. If a game cannot sustain itself with its current marketing structure, just say so and explain that this is the reason new financial implementations are being added. Do NOT decorate the playerbase with colorful rhetoric and dry PR statements saying ""this is to make things better for YOU!"" Doing this makes people look like greedy parasites with only financial gain in mind *cough* starts with T and ends in N *cough*, and I for one do not wish to give my money to such people.

I watched the anime from the original series all the way to 5D's, but didnt follow it after that. Since graduating high school I havent been able to play yugioh and connect with my friends like I used to. With busy lives it just prooved too difficult to gather with our cards to play. When Yugioh Duel links first came out a good friend of mine told me to download it, and I have been playing it since (December 2016). Being a fanboy, I love leveling up the characters I loved from the anime and trying to recreate their decks. I probably play more PvE than PvP in Duel links, but I play PvP for the rewards and when I want a real challenge. I think the interface and layout are good, the stages and duelist levels make PvE fun and engaging, there's always a goal I'm working towards. like any Trading card game it's pretty much a pay to win in PvP, but I dont spend much (probably like 50-70 dollars in my two years playing) and I have plenty of fun. Around Gold level in ranked no one spends much on the game, but Platinum and above is just a spending game. So I've always stayed in gold (a few seasons in plat) and actually dont mind it, it's plenty competitve. I also enjoy the skills added to the game, and that all characters have their own unique skills. I'd definitely reccomend the game.

All other nations just burn down 95% of the time...- Hit russian tanks into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happens... nothing! hit other nations on same place, instakill!!- Kill the commander on a german tank, even if gunner still lives the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore. Kill a russian commander.... nothing tank can fire normally.- Kill German gunner while reloading, gunner is replaced and reloading starts from anew. Kill Russian gunner during reload, reloading continues from the point where it was before the gunner died :)- Russian IT1 missile has an obvious bug and can fly trough solid buildings and walls wich you can't penetrate with tank shells or any other missile carriers. It's been reported months ago, still no fix and I don't think it ever will be...- Gunners on Bombers lol, British, German and Jap gunners on full level are fairly useless. They hardly hit planes chasing you on 300m.Russian gunners are of course all pro snipers, hitting planes on 1km and taking them down rather easily. Not sure how many kills I made on Russian Bombers, but it's an ridiculous amount. I'd be really curious to see stats about that...US Bombers are soso, due to immense turret numbers they may hit sometimes too and take chsing planes down.

2292,10870,10874,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI have had used Steam for about 12 years and this is my first ever steam review. This game is fantastic.It's easy to pick up but there is lots of tactical and strategic room for growth. Some say it is like Hearthstone but much better, and I would agree with that. It has a healthier economy (ie it is more rewarding and gives you more cards without having to spend money). But if you want to spend money to speed up your collection, that is always an option.I would compare it more to the card game Magic the Gathering. It takes the best of Magic and Hearthstone and leaves the worst out.The single player campaigns are pretty fun and give you a good start for your collection, then there are several game modes to play after that: Gauntlet (free AI challenge with decent rewards) Forge (draft mode against AI where you get to keep the cards you draft) Draft (draft mode against other people where you keep the cards you draft) Puzzles (exasctly what it sounds like--puzzles to help you learn strategy and game mechanics) Casual (unranked play against player opponents) Ranked (ranked ladder play against player opponents)The card quality is great, and the game is surprisingly well balanced. The developers have done a great job to maintain balance in the card pool. There is diversity in the ""meta,"" which is to say that there hasn't been one single deck that has dominated over everything else, because every strategy can be countered.The game is still pretty new, and there is only the base set and one expansion set out so far, but there are already a TON of cards and there is no shortage of cards or ideas for decks. The game was just made in a way that makes sense, and the devs have really put alot of thought into it. Have a cool deck you want to share with your friend? Easy, there is an export button in-game. Find a cool deck online that you want to try out? Easy--you can copy the deck and import it with one button. Super user-friendly.If you are interested in theorycrafting, there is a great community here, on reddit, and other forums as well. People post deck lists all the time and there are plenty of startegy articles to get you started. Here are a couple sites that are pretty popular to check out: www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame  (reddit discussions) www.rngeternal.com  (discussions about strategy, meta, etc.) www.eternalwarcry.com  (easy place to post a deck idea or see what others have come up with)All in all, cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is interested in this type of game.

2296,5818,5822,DCS World Steam Edition,Firstly people need to realise that you are NOT flying a real plane! but infact a game. i have played almost every flight simulator there is and have very much loved most. i dont become obsessed with every detail being exact like switch on the electrics and what not because again this is a game. People that say this isn't for you because your not experienced or a real pilot is bullsh*t. It's for anyone that wants to give it a try. Now i will say that it is a beautifully made game but i'll be honest and say even i struggled with it. all flight sims i have played have been straight forward with same detail as this game but this one is just well...frustrating. all i can say is the contols need to much more clear and not scattered around the keyboard. Just in general this game needs a bit more help or explaining through most of it. especially for players who want to try this or are new to it. Don't get me wrong guys they have done a superb job with this game and i know its free it just needs better flight control. also i will at some point try my THRUSTMASTER HOTAS COUGAR flight stick but just cannot be arsed with mapping it out yet lol.,1, firstly people need realise flying real plane infact game played flight simulator loved nt obsessed detail exact like switch electrics game people experienced real pilot wants try beautifully game honest struggled flight sims played straight forward detail game frustrating contols need clear scattered keyboard general game needs bit help explaining especially players want try new wrong guys superb job game know free needs better flight control point try thrustmaster hotas cougar flight stick arsed mapping lol

2299,11102,11106,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThe best bits of MTG and Hearthstone with (almost) all the bad removed.    Infinitely cheaper than MTG, with a way more generous F2P model giving it an edge over hearthstone as well.   The 5-colour mana system allows a wider range of decks and more deck-tuning options than hearthstone's rigid class-based system.    The problems of mana flood/screw which plague MTG have been minimized by the way the game forces a certain number of power cards (lands) in your starting hand.  Health returning to full at the end of turns (like in MTG) in addition to the fact that the defending player chooses how blockers are assigned in combat, destroys the ""Curvestone"" problem of brainless ""1 drop, 2 drop, 3 drop"" decks being overwhelmingly effective. The basic game mechanics encourage and reward slower decks with more interesting decisions!  Being developed by a great team including Legendary MTG pro-player Luis Scott-Vargas  The bad  As it currently stands, the game doesn't explain some of the more intricate interactions very well, and kind of assumes a certain level of MTG knowledge. For example, if you try chump blocking a creature with overwhelm (AKA trample in MTG) and deadly (AKA Deathtouch), you might be surprised when your 4 health defender only blocks one of the damage and the rest hits you. You can certainly play this game never having touched MTG, but you might run into a few moments like these that might feel unfair.   The starting campaign was a bit of a slog to get through for new players, and didn't really do the job of a tutorial in that it didn't teach about the kind of interactions mentioned above. HOWEVER, the introduction campaign has just been reworked and seems to be much more engaging now.  If you have ever had even a passing interest in MTG or Hearthstone, you should try out Eternal. Most of the problems that have turned people I know away from other CCGs have been put to rest in this game.

It's free but I felt it worth getting the one-time starter pack since I'd played for a number of hours and was enjoying it.A few tips:- When you can send people out to the wasteland leave them out for a while, it seems to take time before you start getting items.- Make sure you have nuka cola quantum if possible to avoid long waits for getting to quest areas and coming back from them. That said, once your vault has enough people in it to keep going while people are away questing it can be good to send people off to pick up weapons, schematics and other gear.- Try to send people who are higher level then what the quest needs and ideally send a party of 3 with as much stim packs and rad away as possible (click the max button for each as due to a bug the items won't be available in the quest if you add the items one by one). Rad away is sometimes useful, but you'll usually need one or more stim packs.",1, bit simple fun good time waster like collecting stuff expanding vault going occasional quests free felt worth getting time starter pack played number hours enjoying send people wasteland leave time start getting sure nuka cola quantum possible avoid long waits getting quest areas coming said vault people going people away questing good send people pick weapons schematics try send people higher level quest needs ideally send party stim packs rad away possible click max button bug items wo available quest add items rad away useful usually need stim packs
2302,2787,2790,War Thunder,"I recommened and don't recommend War Thunder for several reasons. 1. The grind.I have invested a decent amount of hours, I haven't gotten to the jet tier. I had just started the tier right before. Inorder for me to research a new attacker, fighter, bomber, etc. I need to invest several games worth. My average RP (research points) ranges from 100-200 in losses and 600+ depending on kills, majortiy of matches i complete are rewarding me with 1000 RP. A bomber that I'd like to research requires 75,000 RP...that's 75 matches in order to complete one plane, thats just the avg. rp gain of 1000, so not every match will give me 1000. A fighter is 30,000. 30 matches or more or less. Now the grind at first was fun, the first 3 tiers were very enjoyable for tanks and planes, but I can't stand playing long matches and getting barely enough RP to get a new plane. By this rate I'll get the jets in a few months if i play to my own leisure. 2. The urge to pay for GEGE (golden eagles) are premium currancy. You can instantly research and purchase planes, tanks, and modifications with them. I have spent roughly $10 on War Thunder, that isn't too bad considering that $6 gives (I'm assuming around) 1,000 GE. Well as you go down the plane or tank branchs you notice the RP gets higher, the more RP the more GE it takes to instantly research or aid the research. Not only is does GE just finish or aid research, you can use your GE to activate a premium account for 'x' amount of days according to your GE amount. When you have a premium account your awards are nearly doubled/you get more rewards then the usual. I personally feel like there is a large urge to purchase these GE in late game progress; however, it is a F2P game so I can't really complain.3. constant updates.Something is too weak, something is too strong. Now let's reverse it and see what happens. I have always enjoyed flying the P-47D, which was a American bomber hunter fighter. As a bomber hunter (interceptor) you spawn near your own bombers. Well the P-47D is now a fighter and i have to take off the air strip, I can't provide my friendly bombers with a escort or attack the enemy bombers. By the time I'm at the alt. of 3k or 4k we already have a base or two gone. As it may seem that I'm just complaining about my issue, that isn't the case. Many planes and tanks are being constantly nerfed or buffed, this may sound good and on some level, it is. But this causes the balance and meta to constantly change. For example: a German BF109 could have used to fear a American P-47D (which was usually never the case), well next week it could be reversed. 4. The communityThe community in war thunder, least from my experiences, is really great. Majority of people are helpful and kind. This is most likely one of my favorites of war thunder. War thunder is a F2P game that is worth a try, if your willing to put in the hours and rack up kills, then you'll thrive in this game. The GE are not to pricy at times, the community is good, when they release big updates it's always exciting (like they're new one 'Project X'). I generally think War thunder could improve in many areas, but i also think War Thunder is doing good at where it's at and what it's doing. Yet, in the end I do have to not recommend this game due to how bothersome the grind is.",0, recommened recommend war thunder reasons grind invested decent hours gotten jet tier started tier right inorder research new attacker fighter bomber etc need invest games worth average rp research points ranges losses depending kills majortiy matches complete rewarding rp bomber like research requires rp matches order complete plane s avg rp gain match fighter matches grind fun tiers enjoyable tanks planes stand playing long matches getting barely rp new plane rate jets months play leisure urge pay gege golden eagles premium currancy instantly research purchase planes tanks modifications spent roughly war thunder bad considering gives assuming ge plane tank branchs notice rp gets higher rp ge takes instantly research aid research ge finish aid research use ge activate premium account x days according ge premium account awards nearly doubled rewards usual personally feel like large urge purchase ge late game progress game constant updates weak strong let reverse happens enjoyed flying american bomber hunter fighter bomber hunter interceptor spawn near bombers fighter air strip provide friendly bombers escort attack enemy bombers time alt base gone complaining issue case planes tanks constantly nerfed buffed sound good level causes balance meta constantly change example german fear american usually case week reversed communitythe community war thunder experiences great majority people helpful kind likely favorites war thunder war thunder game worth try willing hours rack kills thrive game ge pricy times community good release big updates exciting like new project x generally think war thunder improve areas think war thunder good end recommend game bothersome grind

Though it gets laggy sometimes in the city. - I like the taming system, as a pet lover it's really fun for me. - I love to go around and discover new places, the world seems fine for me, the thing is it feels somewhat empty (from GW2 player view). For a casual player I think the game is pretty good for time killer. The game is playable but it would be a lot better if the combat and jumping feels more smooth.

This game is free and free always comes with a catch so yes there are microtransactions so yes you will have to grind to get cards for free. This realization going in should not shock anyone.I have played on and off the past few months and have about 100 hours put into it and have yet to spend a single cent all the while I have built a great deck and have achieved gold tier in ranked duels. The only issue of the game being while the npc duels are fun at first they are the grind you have to do and become boring. The game is best (In my opinion) during its pvp matching because of the challange. Climbing the ranked ladder was fun for me because I enjoy that challange. Did I have to do some grinding to get where I am? Of course but im having fun and thats all that matters.

If someone uses real money to purchase a gun you'll feel it, the game is very much, pay to win.Free credits are not well balanced, specifically designed to be hard to earn to buy new weapons, so that you'll be more tempted to use your hard earned cash.You think that if a game was to have hard to earn rewards, it'd take a Planetside 2 approach, and make all guns have strengths, weaknesses and be overall balanced. but they are not. The Thompson for example is the be all end all of submachine guns, I picked one up from an enemy and a quick burst of 3 bullets to the chest was all it took to down an enemy.however with the Grease Gun, america's starting SMG it took around 20, requiring the full clip if you miss.The german starting SMG is also stronger than the Grease Gun as well.There's not a large variety of guns either, which makes me question it a little, considering that I remember a larger array of weaponry in similar WW2 shooters.The game is fun, refreshing even, however the unfairness of it's economy and weapon tier system really ruin the fun.Unbalanced weaponry and inconsistent weapons between both factions, leaves something to be desired.This game would really benefit from leaving it's limitations, creating a third fictional faction to make battles 3 ways, or even adding the ability for 3 way battles which would include weaponry specific to that faction based in that time frame.This game is in need of a massive overhaul in order to improve player satisfaction and balance between all players, new and long running.Also, a quick mention for server maintenance, this game is riddled with it, atleast 30% of the time when I want to jump on, there's server maintenance, and this isn't for short periods of time, these are long downtimes, that when the time to be taken is predicted, takes anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, and when the maintenance is unexpected bugfixes or anything along those lines, the game can be done for a whole night, with no time given to players as to when it'll be back up.My verdict: a good game turned sour by it's online shop.6/10",0, early access reviewthis game mixed bag hard decide recommend mind game enjoyable different maps career paths lot like game lot types games ruined economy atleast fractions economy exception guns overpriced overpowered uses real money purchase gun feel game pay win free credits balanced specifically designed hard earn buy new weapons tempted use hard earned cash think game hard earn rewards planetside approach guns strengths weaknesses overall balanced thompson example end submachine guns picked enemy quick burst bullets chest took grease gun america starting smg took requiring clip miss german starting smg stronger grease gun large variety guns makes question little considering remember larger array weaponry similar shooters game fun refreshing unfairness economy weapon tier system ruin fun unbalanced weaponry inconsistent weapons factions leaves desired game benefit leaving limitations creating fictional faction battles ways adding ability way battles include weaponry specific faction based time frame game need massive overhaul order improve player satisfaction balance players new long running quick mention server maintenance game riddled atleast time want jump server maintenance short periods time long downtimes time taken predicted takes hours maintenance unexpected bugfixes lines game night time given players verdict good game turned sour online

No, all the cash you spend isn't gonna get you any better at the game despite all the loot you purchase, we've all seen newbs die horribly with tops.

2331,10997,11001,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThis is a much better game IMO than Hearthstone, ESL, or many other digital card games out there.  It is simpler than MTG but keeps many of the same rules that are abandoned by more recent card games such as playing mana and instants.  Unfortunately it has already fallen into the problems that led me to quit Hearthstone long ago-- the fact that there are very rare patches and balance changes.  In the past 3-4 months there have only been a handful of new cards and only a couple small balance changes.  In the current age of sharing decks online, this philosophy leads to extremely stale matches against many similar decks.  I think this could be a great game if the developers took a more liberal approach to making changes in the game, but at this point even if they did, the playerbase has dwindled significantly since it released in early access.",0, early access reviewthis better game imo hearthstone esl digital card games simpler mtg keeps rules abandoned recent card games playing mana instants unfortunately fallen problems led quit hearthstone long fact rare patches balance changes past months handful new cards couple small balance changes current age sharing decks online philosophy leads extremely stale matches similar decks think great game developers took liberal approach making changes game point playerbase dwindled significantly released early access
2332,13843,13847,Dreadnought,"Let me say that right now many reviews left for this game have been due to very little experience or express sheer negativity due to what's expected to be temporary issues during the shaky Steam launch. As such, the opinion of many have only scratched the surface of what a gem this game is. I'm sure the server issues and other feedback received will be put into effect soon enough.With that out of the way, onto my perspective of the game; I've been a semi-veteran player of this game for a long time and I've seen the rise and fall of Dreadnought phases prior to Steam. I assure that when the game is out of the current funk, it is an absolute blast. I'll say now that Dreadnought is graphically a rather appealing game; the explosions, particle effects, and general environment all feel well-designed. Each class of ship is unique and all are worth playing. I would say that 80% of my games I've played have had people playing all roles by desire. The progression in Dreadnought is slow and steady but it feels proper; early progression playing in the recruit fleets gets you a good feel for the game and you learn a lot of stuff from your experience here as you grind out your ships to get to the next tiers. Most of your time and grind will be in the veteran fleet as this provides the most diverse and immediate gameplay. You're rewarded for trying new things and whether your win or lose, it's a fun time!I will say that the integration to Steam came with a few flaws outside of the current server problems; a couple of troublesome bugs are still existent in the game though they are not necessarily gamebreaking. Also, the new UI is cumbersome to navigate and some of the new sounds in the game are less than stellar. Some sounds that sounded great before are questionable now, but also on the flipside, some sounds lackluster before are now much better!In conclusion; before you pass on this game due to the constant reviews talking about what is mostly temporary problems, consider spending a few hours trying the game out, especially after the servers settle. If commanding a spaceship to go into battle has been one of your desires, Dreadnought will not disappoint!",1, let right reviews left game little experience express sheer negativity expected temporary issues shaky steam launch opinion scratched surface gem game sure server issues feedback received effect soon way perspective game semi veteran player game long time seen rise fall dreadnought phases prior steam assure game current funk absolute blast dreadnought graphically appealing game explosions particle effects general environment feel designed class ship unique worth playing games played people playing roles desire progression dreadnought slow steady feels proper early progression playing recruit fleets gets good feel game learn lot stuff experience grind ships tiers time grind veteran fleet provides diverse immediate gameplay rewarded trying new things win lose fun integration steam came flaws outside current server problems couple troublesome bugs existent game necessarily gamebreaking new ui cumbersome navigate new sounds game stellar sounds sounded great questionable flipside sounds lackluster conclusion pass game constant reviews talking temporary problems consider spending hours trying game especially servers settle commanding spaceship battle desires dreadnought disappoint

2334,13272,13276,Tactical Monsters Rumble Arena,"This is a hard one to review, cause i really like the gameplay, and it really is quite tactical. But at the same time you fundamentally grind to win (or pay 2 win).It's not about cosmetics here, the purchaces you make are to avoid grinding. And you HAVE to grind to compete in this game, even just to progress in the PVE.The game starts out easy, and you quickly see the potential of the combat system. But as you progress you'll see the importance of leveling your cards (or paying to level them fast) as your skill becomes increasingly irrelevant, and the strength and abilities starts to decide your victories instead.The game claims in it's decription that you can play against friends ""Play with your friends in 1 on 1 virtual battles..."" but i have so far not seen any option to do so.Instead the only option you really have is to grind and grind until you have the highest level cards, so that you can finally compete in PVP and finish PVE with your skill as the deciding factor. (Unless none of your opponents have high level cards, in which case you're just winning cause they haven't grinded or paid 2 win yet.)The game also hosts ""lootboxes"", which can be fun, but is none the less gambling, and ultimately abuses addictive personalities. Not to mention how damaging a gambling addiction in general can be.Whilst i do enjoy the gameplay, the game itself is build on this foundation of grind till you die or pay 2 win.So i have to conclude that this game is ultimately bad for you, and not worth the small amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it.Edit 14/03/2017: 15:04 (GMT +1)I'm also fairly sure the game is riddled with fake reviews, cause almost every single top rated review is negative, yet the game is 90% Positive... wat?http://steamcommunity.com/app/705220/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&snr=1_5_reviews_And they also seem to have a bot answering most of the reviews, just read how random each answer is, like an advertisement reply in every review.",0, hard review cause like gameplay tactical time fundamentally grind win pay cosmetics purchaces avoid grinding grind compete game progress game starts easy quickly potential combat system progress importance leveling cards paying level fast skill increasingly irrelevant strength abilities starts decide victories instead game claims decription play friends play friends virtual battles far seen option instead option grind grind highest level cards finally compete pvp finish pve skill deciding factor opponents high level cards case winning cause grinded paid win game hosts lootboxes fun gambling ultimately abuses addictive personalities mention damaging gambling addiction general whilst enjoy gameplay game build foundation grind till die pay win conclude game ultimately bad worth small enjoyment edit gmt fairly sure game riddled fake reviews cause single rated review negative game positive bot answering reviews read random answer like advertisement reply review

It's true, there is a lot of grinding for XP, but the players I've met were friendly and didn't hesitate to help with the ""harder"" bosses. (I've reached the maximum level, which is 20 atm, in about 2 weeks so it's not that bad) There is also the story so they aren't really that boring. Take my advice, farm in Ashfall (dragonslayer area), you get high XP from the quests there, and weapons.I like the fact that this is crossplatform, and it even remembers your quest progress if you log off before finishing the quest. A fun game to play when you're not home as well, from your phone. You can play on your computer and then continue the quest on your Android phone, for example.Btw, it's full of Spanish people, so if you know their language you're in luck, but also people from UK, US and other places.

2347,4402,4406,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"So when I played Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist last year, I found it pretty crap, the multiplayer duels didn't really feel fun, the campaign was just ripped straight out of the anime and it was definitely not worth £15 with DLC that adds up to around £65-£70. As for this game... well I saw ads for it in early 2016, it wasn't exactly something that made me wanna play the game... the ad was some 20 year old men saying cringy things, didn't look like Yu-Gi-Oh, looked like a fan movie of Yu-Gi-Oh. Either way, November 2017 and here we are with the PC port of Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links, ported straight from the mobile! :D Currently in the game you can play as characters from the original series and the GX series, I really hope next year they add something for Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's as it's gonna be its 10th anniversary, but for now there's a lot to do as these characters. You start off with either Yugi or Kaiba, which is... a really weird choice isn't it? the 2 most popular characters straight away? Shouldn't they be like final bosses or something? well either way, you come across Yugi's friends such as Tea, Joey, Pegasus (not exactly his friend but y'know) and some others which I haven't gotten to myself. You duel them and unlock them, you don't have to just duel these guys, you can duel people online or random AI people. Eventually you will unlock a new world which allows you to play as Jaden Yuki, the protagonist from GX, you can then unlock Chazz, Alexis and probably the rest of Jaden's friends throughout the GX series. They better put something for 5D's at some point, I mean it would equal a lot more playtime for a lot of people and it would probably get more people interested in playing the game.The gameplay is like any other Yu-Gi-Oh game, you place monsters, spells, traps, fusion summon, tribute summon, synchro summ- nvm you can do everything but that last one. Except this time you only get 6 card slots, 3 for monsters, 3 for traps/spells... what the hell? This can't be because its a mobile game, because Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Generation has the regular 10 slots (5 for monsters, 5 for spells/traps) but this one limits that... weird... also, I don't understand why the life points were reduced to 4000 instead of 8000 like in all the other games... was it to make duels quicker? because sometimes they can end really quickly if you know what you're doing, or if you're against AI.... and duels can end in 13 seconds with the auto-duel feature you'll eventually achieve, which plays the game for you... is it fun? not really, its funny for the first couple of duels, but its not exactly useful, if you need to get to another stage and you need to use specific cards, you should probably not auto duel. I did make a negative review for this game before, but that was before I actually started playing for real and after playing it... while it is annoying that there's only 6 slots and there's a bunch of ""daily login"" mobile pop-ups (which btw should not be in a PC game) its still a decent game, you can transfer data from your mobile version to the PC so if you've played it since it came out, you should probably do that it'll save you the hassle of doing everything all over again. If you want to play a good Yu-Gi-Oh game on PC you should definitely try this, its a bit boring at the start and has a really slow beginning but it eventually becomes addicting, especially if you have friends who constantly wanna duel you.",1, played yu gi oh legacy duelist year found pretty crap multiplayer duels feel fun campaign ripped straight anime definitely worth dlc adds game saw ads early exactly wanna play game ad year old men saying cringy things look like yu gi oh looked like fan movie yu gi oh way november pc port yu gi oh duel links ported straight mobile currently game play characters original series gx series hope year add yu gi oh gon na anniversary lot characters start yugi kaiba weird choice popular characters straight away like final bosses way come yugi friends tea joey pegasus exactly friend gotten duel unlock duel guys duel people online random ai people eventually unlock new world allows play jaden yuki protagonist gx unlock chazz alexis probably rest jaden friends gx series better point mean equal lot playtime lot people probably people interested playing game gameplay like yu gi oh game place monsters spells traps fusion summon tribute summon synchro nvm time card slots monsters traps spells hell mobile game yu gi oh duel generation regular slots monsters spells traps limits weird understand life points reduced instead like games duels quicker end quickly know ai duels end seconds auto duel feature eventually achieve plays game fun funny couple duels exactly useful need stage need use specific cards probably auto duel negative review game actually started playing real playing annoying slots bunch daily login mobile pop ups btw pc game decent game transfer data mobile version pc played came probably save hassle want play good yu gi oh game pc definitely try bit boring start slow beginning eventually addicting especially friends constantly wanna duel

2350,8226,8230,Neverwinter,"First of all this is not a pay to win game. ZEN is a currency you can buy with real money. You can convert ZEN into Astral Diamonds or do the opposite - AD into ZEN. AD can be achieved by doing daily quests and is the trading currency used in the Auction House and several merchants. You can buy ZEN to quicken your progression or make the game more convenient(e.g. extra inventory slots, respec tokens, rare companions and more). ZEN converted into AD can get you rare and powerful items from the Auction House. Only difference a paying user could have, is if he bought a Starter pack or Guardian of Neverwinter pack and he would receive exclusive gear, mounts/companions, enchants. They barely affect gameplay and only have vanity value, rather than becoming stronger. All content is the same either you're a paying user or a free user, it depends on how much are you willing to grind. You can grind to get AD and then trade it for something you want.

2353,15100,15105,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewJust uninstalled.I must admit, a lot of it was part of personal preference, and it was kind of sad to do so. I want to like this game. The devs can do whatever they want, but that doesn't mean I have to like what they do. Some of the ""taste"" changes have been so bizarre and unjustifiable that the game is no longer fun.A lot of people reference the removal of tiers as the beginning of the end, but I didn't mind it so much. The game wanted to change, and it was a change I was personally fine with. For me, the game ended with Epic Loot. For those who don't know, it essentially turned the typical currency-reward system into RNG loot drops at the end of each match. While I admit that it allowed the devs to remove premium items and made them obtainable by F2P peeps, it also destroyed the most important part of the game.Thanks to Epic Loot, you can forget about building what you want.I kept returning to this game over the years and have no idea why. With RNG loot, I can't build anything I want. I have half of a cosmetic mask thanks to Epic Loot, but I also have no good plane parts or heli parts. You name it, I don't have it. Everyone should at least be able to make a respectable bot in the form that they want, and everyone used to be able to do it.But now, you can't. This game is Robocraft without the craft.It gets worse. For some reason, the game devs have some sort of thing for removing gameplay. Maybe I can't find the classic elimination game mode or the protonium crystal battle arena because I'm asian, although the more likely explanation is that they got removed and replaced. There have been many other changes, such as the removal of megabots, that I can kind of understand. Some things need to be fixed, and if they need removal, so be it. Unfortunately, they haven't been replaced with anything remotely interesting, just like pretty much everything in this game over the years.This game took away the building, and it took away core gameplay over the years. In the future, this cycle will only continue and the devs have no idea when, where, or how to stop. This game is dead in my eyes.

Check out my Dota 2 Stats, Im ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Following my simple guide, you will be on your way to dealing with baddies and becoming awesome, like me.One of the worst communities ever, its not even the fact that they are obnoxious, annoying or racist. Its the fact that they so willingly blame others, they fail to improve their own gameplay after hours and hours of experience. The people who talk the most are quite literally the worst players. Pro Tip: Mute them and tell them you muted them so they begin type less and focus on playing. The idiots spouting the worse non-sense are utter garbage and there are too many.

Sometimes it is better to humble them so they dont make themselves look dumb as hell the next time they decide to say stupid things.Sometimes its better to let them ride it out because they simply cannot help themselves. I found out from my friends they will frequently move onto another subject matter when they realize senpai is not noticing them :(Pro Tip #3: Have fun, dont let these raging morons ruin the game for you like they did me. If you follow Pro Tips 1 & 2, the reactions to the ragers is priceless, it demolishes their spirit and will think twice about their redherring tactics and actually l2p and git gud.Extra: Had one guy messaging me for several weeks and creating different accounts in order to throw racial slurs.

2361,5436,5440,World of Tanks Blitz,"World of Tanks Blitz is a mobile free-to-play team-based MMO action game dedicated to fierce tank combat. Available both on smartphones and tablets, the game puts a mobile twist on traditional dynamic online tank combat.The game looks pretty nice with graphics, and doesn’t really requires a high-end PC unlike War Thuder, making it a perfect option for players with worse PC’s.The only problem with the game is that it’s tank mechanics aren’t super realistic, doesn’t even makes sense sometimes. The first drawback is that the tanks have HP bars, and to destory a tank, you need to first drain all their HP, the case is that, sometimes it will be frustrating, as sometimes a tank with super low HP will kill you, but in reality that tank would probably stop working after taking many hits. The other unrealistic mechanic is the enemy spotting mechanic, now when you are driving around when you get closer to an enemy, you will instantly be notified, and will see which tank the enemy is, their HP and pretty much everything else. This pretty much ruins the ability of ambushing, or hiding, you will sometimes also face an frustrating problem when you have spotted an enemy that is far away and when they move slightly back then you will not see the enemy. Besides that the game being free-to-play it has a lot of in-game purchases, it’s not really a pay-to-win game as with cash you can only get better tanks and a better crew, although when you get a better tank you get matched against other users with better tanks. The game also sometimes holds events but free users can’t grab anything from, you need to pay if you actually want something from it.So in conclusion, I just didn’t liked it, I’m not saying it’s bad, it's just not too enjoyable",0, world tanks blitz mobile free play team based mmo action game dedicated fierce tank combat available smartphones tablets game puts mobile twist traditional dynamic online tank combat game looks pretty nice graphics requires high end pc unlike war thuder making perfect option players worse problem game tank mechanics super realistic makes sense drawback tanks hp bars destory tank need drain hp case frustrating tank super low hp kill reality tank probably stop working taking hits unrealistic mechanic enemy spotting mechanic driving closer enemy instantly notified tank enemy hp pretty pretty ruins ability ambushing hiding face frustrating problem spotted enemy far away slightly enemy game free play lot game purchases pay win game cash better tanks better crew better tank matched users better tanks game holds events free users grab need pay actually want conclusion liked saying bad enjoyable

2366,12409,12413,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"Let me start off by saying this is an incredible game. There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them. MultiplayerThe multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races. Payment modelContrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.Now on to the paymeny model. Paying 50€ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50€. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10€ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.I should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it. InterfaceThe interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's Some personal insightI do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience. The sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.Graphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.As an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving.

2374,13080,13084,Fallout Shelter,"Mobile game ported to PC. Fun for the first few hours, after that it may as well be dead. High RNG risk game unless you spend money. Good tip is to rush room and exit game right away if ""FAILED"" to prevent the RNG of failing.Challenges/Objectives are your main source of lunchboxes and pets but they can get very painful and almost impossible with minimal rewards to the point where I gave up and I cannot be bothered to wait a day just to re-roll one of the 3 challenges which could end up being worse. Even though I keep the dweller population low the objectives only get harder as you complete them, so after completing 20 you could still have 10 dwellers and you will get objectives such as ""Survive 30 mole rat attacks"", ""Craft 15 outfits"", ""Get 9 perfect critical hits"" and one of my most hated objectives.... ""Explore 7 locations while in the wasteland"" seriously dumb considering how random and long it takes to find a location while having to be active 100% of the time.

2376,14435,14440,Robocraft,Early Access ReviewThe developers have shown again and again a great example of how to take a really good game and drive it into the ground. I used to recommend this to many friends but after having more and more features removed I am left with no feeling of progression or achievement.Do the developers care about the game? Probably. But in reality it just feels like they are trying to swap the game out from under our feet. I used to invest my time into improving my robot and be really excited to try out a new part but now it's only good for a quick round of shooting things where most of the bots are just the same design. Creativity is gone. Originality is gone. Excitement is gone.This is not the game I supported in the past. It's still a fun game in some ways but be cautious about how attached you get to it. They might decide robots are not what they want in the game anymore and continue making it less unique by turning it into a FPS. It wouldn't suprise me if they did.Oh and if you do play it you should know this. When it says press left shift... they mean right. And while this isn't really a big deal it does describe my opinion on the direction this game is going. Backwards.Disclaimer: I am probably being a little harsh on the game but when you get crapped time after time then it kind of hurts your opinion.,0, early access reviewthe developers shown great example good game drive ground recommend friends having features removed left feeling progression achievement developers care game probably reality feels like trying swap game feet invest time improving robot excited try new good quick round shooting things bots design creativity gone originality gone excitement gone game supported past fun game ways cautious attached decide robots want game anymore continue making unique turning fps suprise oh play know says press left shift mean right big deal describe opinion direction game going backwards disclaimer probably little harsh game crapped time time kind hurts opinion

2382,13983,13987,Infestation: The New Z,"Well, I have to be honest, and I don't think I've ever wrote such an entirely negative review. If you pay attention to a lot of aspects of this game, you realise that the developers probably don't care very much, I know this sounds harsh, but I will explain why I think this. The game itself is entirely generic, to be honest. You go into towns and get guns and food, you try not to die to players and zombies.Issues with the way the game works:Melee weapons:are all the same range despite their models, brass knuckles to polearm-like weapons they all have the same range. Not to mention some of the models are entirely broken, the ""shiv"" is entirely invisible, with no model at all, as well as one of the other weapons entirely losing it's tip when it's jabbed at things. Melee weapons have one attribute: damage, that is the only thing to them other than looks, and I'm fairly certain they all attack at the same speed. Not to mention the very best melee weapon you can get doesn't work propperly and will miss the opponent often enough that it is not usable at all, seeing as you -will- take damage using it because enemies will not be stunned by your hits.Skill tree:Not only does this skill tree only have a handful of skills, they're entirely generic. If you're looking for a unique character compared to other people's characters, you will -not- have any luck. That's not even the end of it. If you wanted to be a melee based character, prepare to also be forced to invest points into sniper based traits. Not to mention these benefits are so tiny that you wont notice them, you'll also question if they even coded it correctly and the traits work in the first place as they don't tell you by how much they will increase your abilities.Path 2:Survivalist, which makes you not need to eat as often or drink as often, which, without the perks you will NEVER have a problem with, EVER. (You wont even have to pay attention to your food and water values even after playing for hours on end)Path 3:Health and stamina increase path.Path 4: (SUPER EXPENSIVE exp-wise) Gives you pretty sizable increases to damage, and doubles stamina, etc.- Point is, don't expect anything special.Silly random things:Like a wooden baracade making a C4 explosion sound when it breaks and alerting everyone in the area of your presence. DESPITE ALL THIS, I did have some fun playing it. It is free and I had a lot of laughs with my friends at all the glitches like having to jump over a curb because you can't step over it during an intense zombie chase. The one thing that I really like about the game is that they have -tons- of guns. I've honestly never seen a game with so many guns.Do I think this game could ever become more than it is now? No, to be honest, it's a very generic premise. I don't want to see another game with such low effort conceptually. I know it's a free game, but they're obviously making a lot of money off of this, since this is their second itteration of the game. Which, they didn't change barely anything between the games, seriously, I've played both, it's the same game. Maps are the same, zombie models, almost everything, not an exaggeration. It just boasts slightly improved graphics.To the developers, please, find someone with an imagination, you don't have it. I give the game (1/10)PS: Survival mode is a complete mess where you wont see food or water spawn, and you cannot drink out of the large bodies of water. No special skill tree for survival. Expect to see 40 guns or melee weapons before seeing a single food or water item.

2383,5152,5156,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewBrawlhalla; An online Steam version of Smash Brothers, if you will. Like plenty of other all-out multiplayer fighting games, your outlook on this game really depends on your outlook of fighting games in general; If you're a competitive player, you'll probably be a nuisance and complain about the slightest flaws in the games, characters or level design and get turned off my minor issues like that. If you play for fun, however, you'd enjoy the multiplayer experience alongside the fact that it is able to be played with a controller, so no keyboard troubles for you (that is, if you have the USB corb & controller)! The characters are notably memorable from the gnarly ""overpowered"" Gnash to the hustling ""surprisingly female"" Hattori. Each have their own different weapon choices, which makes for different scenarios and unique battles, so long as you don't annoyingly and unnecessarily complain about their ""being overpowered"" or flaws, as that's personal and others can totally prove you wrong. As of now, new characters are being added to the shop, alongside the prior DLC in the forms of Valkris, (as you spell it in-game) weapon skins and costume skins. Each one is unique, and if you got some spare money or would care to costume up some of your personal favorite Brawlhalla characters, go for it! A few bucks would be worth it on a unique look. The recently-new level system made it so that you could obtain gold, skin colors and prior stances for each character. The only problem with the leveling system can get quite tedious a certain of levels in, it's still worth it for some prior stances, skin colors and gold for future characters. They have a ranking system and just a 'for fun' online free-for-all option. The ranking system goes from bronze and progresses a few gems up, and just try not to get frustrated as if you lose, you're likely to get deranked depending on your rank. One notable advantage from Brawlhalla opposed to Smash Brothers is the lack of long updates required to go online and the relative ease of being able to connect online and join a room with friends, not to mention it's quite easy to drop out and spectate. Although Brawlhalla is still being updated and some of the stages are either opinionatedly bland, trippy, or just ""frustrating"", Brawlhalla is an amazing Steam versioned substitute for Smash Brothers, and although it isn't quite as good, it is definitely worth the $13 purchase.

2385,2248,2251,Path of Exile,"Not for the faint of heart of patience, but if you enjoy Diablo-esque gear grinders, this will definitely scratch that itch. Be prepared to understand nothing and feel a bit overwhelmed by the passive tree. I'd recommend picking a build from a site like timstips and following it for your first character since there's no sort of tutorial and it's very difficult to undo large mistakes made during leveling. Once you've played a character through the first couple difficulties, you will likely understand what you do and don't like about it, and be able to better build a new one.Despite being a free to play, it is not a pay to win.

2386,12729,12733,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"------------------------Updated ReviewFebruary 25, 2015------------------------Well, I decided to spend a little more time on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and admittedly, it is a lot better than when I tried it last year.  I've been able to complete single player AI racing on two tracks, and I can practice on three tracks.  The selection of cars is a little better for being free, but still not enough to really keep you entertained.I didn't try the online portion of this, partially because I'm pretty bad at this game (I'm more used to Forza and GT) and partially because most people playing online are using DLC that you need to purchase.This game definitely has great physics, and I'll probably give it another shot using my G27 instead of my Xbox 360 controller.  Unfortunately, I still can't recommend it.  You can pay for a full game like pCARS or Assetto Corsa and receive a lot more content than RaceRoom can deliver in its DLC packs (from what I'm reading).------------------------Old ReviewMay 26, 2014------------------------During the small amount of time I've had playing this, I honestly don't think this is a free-to-play game.  Admittedly, this game feels and plays more like a demo than F2P.Only being able to play hot-lap modes, with one track (a few variants of that one track, but still one location), and very few cars makes this game feel like a joke when advertised as free-to-play.While the gameplay is decent enough, I feel that the control of the cars could be a little better.  Using a G27, I feel as if I can't seem to turn sharp enough to get through some corners unless I slow down to rediculously slow speeds, and that's only using 200 degrees of the wheel.  As a comparison, on Assetto Corsa I can pull decent turns during the curves, and that's using the full 900 degrees of the wheel.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this.  For your simulation fix, I think you'd be better off currently purchasing Assetto Corsa.",0, reviewfebruary decided spend little time raceroom racing experience admittedly lot better tried year able complete single player ai racing tracks practice tracks selection cars little better free entertained try online portion partially pretty bad game forza gt partially people playing online dlc need purchase game definitely great physics probably shot instead xbox controller unfortunately recommend pay game like pcars assetto corsa receive lot content raceroom deliver dlc packs reviewmay small time playing honestly think free play game admittedly game feels plays like demo able play hot lap modes track variants track location cars makes game feel like joke advertised free play gameplay decent feel control cars little better feel turn sharp corners slow rediculously slow speeds degrees wheel comparison assetto corsa pull decent turns curves degrees wheel unfortunately recommend simulation fix think better currently purchasing assetto corsa
2387,5770,5774,DCS World Steam Edition,"I'll narrow this down to the good and the bad points about this game. (Updated 10/13/2015, shortly after graphics overhaul. [NOTE!] So far these upgrades are not shown in the above screenshots)The Good:-A large array of aircraft to fly(if you buy the moduls). Many of which are fully interactive, as in almost every switch and button can be flipped with the click of your mouse(you can rebind the keys as you see fit). The rest of the aircraft are more like simplifed simulations, not fully interactive but easier to learn. As far as I know, they handle realisticly.-Amazing graphics post update! The lighting, weather, and smoke effects are absurdly good, the ground now uses a bump map, meaning flat textures on the ground cast shadows, it really makes the terrain look a million times better. Basically it just looks better and even runs better.-Detailed single player campaigns for each and every aircraft, some single player campaigns very in their difficulty and legnth. For example, the A-10A's campaign features smaller scale misisons that don't require much time to complete. Where as the SU-25's campaign features much larger scale misisons that take much longer to complete(imagine after taking off from your airfield, you must fly for 20-30 minutes to the combat zone, then fly back to land when your mission is complete, Which I guess is more realistic).-Quick misson generators which allow you to practice with your aircarft before doing the campaigns.-One thing I really like is that you can choose your payload, each aircraft has a large variety of weaponry, and it is fun carefully choosing your payload according your mission objective. Variety is such a great thing, and variety is something this game has in large quantities.-The game is very well optimized now, it used to run like garbage even with incredeble hardware, but even after the graphics overhaul, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it did.-The load times have been vastly improved, it used to take 5 minutes to load anything up in this game, now its about 30 seconds to a minute to load. Any subsequent load time is around 15 seconds.Bare in mind my hardware specs are as follows:AMD 8-core 4.0 GHZR9 290 with 4GB of VRAM GDDR512GB 1600MHZ of RAMThe Bad:-expect a minor frame rate dips if our have mirrors and ground clutter active.-The game's training is hit or miss. The SU-25T(which you get for free) has training missions that are interactive. Then you have most of the Flaming cliffs 3 aircraft which have shoddy low res videos, that is out of sync with the sound and voice that is explaining everything. For the Mi-8, the game will only teach you how to turn it on, take off, and how to use the weapons, but it only tells you how to use the rockets, and 2 of the 3 types of gun pods, and doesn't teach you how to use bombs. Worst of all, it did not teach me how to land with the helicopter, which is harder than you may think. I crashed 40 times trying to figure out how to land properly. The game has a steep learning curve, and the training videos just makes an already hard to learn game even more inaccessible.-I find that the default controles are confusing and clunky. I basically had to completely setup and rebind the contols to something more comfortable. This took a lot of time, learning what each function did, then figuring out what my new layout should be. But when your done, your done and can enjoy the game. Keep in mind, you have to completely set up your controles for each indavidual vehicle!In conclusion:If I can add anything more to the review, I will. But overall, the game is great, and I highly reccomend it if you like flight simulators.",1, narrow good bad points game updated shortly graphics overhaul note far upgrades shown large array aircraft buy moduls fully interactive switch button flipped click rebind keys fit rest aircraft like simplifed simulations fully interactive easier learn far know handle graphics post update lighting weather smoke effects absurdly good ground uses bump map meaning flat textures ground cast shadows makes terrain look million times better basically looks better runs single player campaigns aircraft single player campaigns difficulty legnth example campaign features smaller scale misisons require time complete campaign features larger scale misisons longer taking airfield fly minutes combat zone fly land mission complete guess misson generators allow practice aircarft thing like choose payload aircraft large variety weaponry fun carefully choosing payload according mission objective variety great thing variety game large game optimized run like garbage incredeble hardware graphics overhaul game runs lot smoothly load times vastly improved minutes load game seconds minute load subsequent load time seconds bare mind hardware specs follows amd core gb vram gb ramthe minor frame rate dips mirrors ground clutter game training hit miss free training missions interactive flaming cliffs aircraft shoddy low res videos sync sound voice explaining game teach turn use weapons tells use rockets types gun pods teach use bombs worst teach land helicopter harder think crashed times trying figure land properly game steep learning curve training videos makes hard learn game find default controles confusing clunky basically completely setup rebind contols comfortable took lot time learning function figuring new layout enjoy game mind completely set controles indavidual conclusion add review overall game great highly reccomend like flight simulators

2392,17397,17402,School of Dragons,"this game is awful and I really like it.--> don't spend money on it there's multiple accounts of people getting glitches that involve losing items/gems. <--it's really glitchy, there's almost no actual skill, strategy, or puzzlesolving. almost all the quests are fetch quests with poorly written dialogue and an inconsistent objective arrow, and there's not nearly enough quests to keep interest. The only repeatable quest takes about 10 steps and gives you 5 gold, and once it's completed it will likely restart itself against your will. The main form of earning cash in the game is a time-lapse farming game and once you've gotten a stable farm there's no point to earning gold anywhere else.The only real gold sink is randomly spawning chests that will give you cosmetic items for your farm and, in theory, dragon eggs.The game plays primarily like a walking simulator with a dozen or so islands for you to explore that are completely undecorated and uninteractable beyond Berk.-The Glitches-The glitches are plentiful and fantastic. the game often takes multiple tries to boot at all. walking through walls is easy and common. falling through the floor is common. I've had the fishing minigame refuse to quit so I was trapped fishing eternally. My pigs live underground.

2393,1512,1515,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewWhy get this game? Because it blurs the lines between a space shooter and a MOBA so well. The gameplay flows, it is easy to figure out, and yet requires investment to master each of the ship classes and the game tactics. (As it should.) Unlike other free to play games, you are not limited in what ships you can buy, they do not restrict how many you can buy. But is it pay to win?

2394,4061,4065,Team Fortress 2,"This is a very fun game that I would recommend to anyone!I used to not play this game very often, it just didn't seem interesting to me, not one bit. But then, I slowly began to start playing it more and more, and now I'm hooked, and I just love it! The characters (the playable classes), the maps, the game modes, it's nothing but hours of endless fun! Sure, you'll come across hackers every once in a while, and being put on a team with TERRIBLE Teammates isn't exactly uncommon, but all the negative stuff aside, this game is amazing!Even if you don't like shooter games, give this game a chance! It originally wasn't my thing, but now it's my favorite game!There are a lot of things you can do in it, inculding taunts, with the playable classes, and along with that they're all different, which distinct cosmetics, hats, and so on (they also have their own personalites as shown in the ""meet the team"" videos on YouTube, but if you're interested in the actual game rather than the characters, just don't search them up). I've played each class at least once, and yet it's STILL really fun to experiment with them, because there are plenty of things I've never done before with each of them!As for gamemodes, well, there's a ton of them, meaning that if you dislike one, there will be one you'll like! Gamemodes inculde payload, control points, MVM, etc...There are only a couple of problems with this game that I think are worth putting into this review, the first one being matchmaking, the weird way that servers are done. I hope for this to undone in the future. The second problem isn't with the game itself, but with the playerbase, but I understand that there's no way to control people, and people are going to be rude no matter what online game you're playing. The main reason I put the second one is because it's common to come across twelve year old kids (that are too young to even be playing this game) screaming swear words into their micrphones, but just mute them and all is good.Overall, get this game, but as I said earlier, it's NOTHING but hours of endless fun!",1, fun game recommend play game interesting bit slowly began start playing hooked love characters playable classes maps game modes hours endless fun sure come hackers team terrible teammates exactly uncommon negative stuff aside game like shooter games game chance originally thing favorite lot things inculding taunts playable classes different distinct cosmetics hats personalites shown meet team videos youtube interested actual game characters search played class fun experiment plenty things gamemodes ton meaning dislike like gamemodes inculde payload control points mvm etc couple problems game think worth putting review matchmaking weird way servers hope undone future second problem game playerbase understand way control people people going rude matter online game playing main reason second common come year old kids young playing game screaming swear words micrphones mute good overall game said earlier hours endless fun

I know mana flood and draught has always been a thing but even when i followed guides on how to minimize this or avoid it. I could only get decent amount of mana and get my deck to work 2/10 times. That says to me it's a balancing issue or their deck shuffling is garbage. Enjoy the game if you like it but for me it's just not my cup of tea. Shame to since I was saving all my gold to complete a quest to join a draft. I'd probably return if they fix these two issues and stop making drafts so damn expensive. 5000 gold just to join one? Damn it's only 3000 for an event. Oh and one last issue the campaign is super short with only one additional battle after that. If you want to play more of it you have to pony up some real world cash. An option to unlock the campaigns with cash or the in game currency would be nice.

2413,10584,10588,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewEternal combines the best parts of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering to create a CCG experience that is similar to both but unlike either. MTG players will recognize mechanics similar to lands, dual lands, instants, five different mana colors, and battle mechanics like trample, deathtouch, lifesteal, first strike, and flying. Because this game is digital, it can do things that you could never do with physical MTG cards, like the Warcry mechanic that add +1/+1 to the top unit of your deck when you attack. There are much fewer RNG elements here than Hearthstone, and some nice of themes to build your deck around like an army of valkyries, a gang of gunslingers, a pack of dniosaurs, or suicidal grenadins.Progression feels so much more rewarding than in Hearthstone! In addition to daily quests, you also get a free card pack for your first win of the day, and these packs have TWELVE cards instead of five AND include enough crafting materials to make a common or uncommon card of your choice. Yes, you get crafting materials IN the card packs! You also get gold for every win (not every 3 wins) which can be spent on card packs. There is also a leveling system in place for each of the 5 factions (red, blue, green, black, and white). When you level up in a faction, you get additional rewards like gold or a free pack, and XP is earned based on the decks you play. So focus on one or two colors to level those up faster, or run a rainbow deck (and there are some GREAT rainbow decks) to level up all five evenly.You have the typical PvP modes like casual, ranked, and a draft pick that is extraodinary! After you pay the entry fee, you open a bunch of randomized card packs and then pick and pass to create a pool, and from that pool you create a deck. It's almost exactly like something you'd see at a MTG event. There are also PvE modes here. The Gauntlet has you fight AI opponents using any custom decks you've created, and Forge is like Hearthstone's draft pick mode. There are a few campaigns that have a steep entry fee but give you guaranteed rewards.All in all, I really enjoy Eternal far more than Hearthstone or Magic. And oh yeah, there is a mobile app as well, so I can play on the bus to work.

2414,15312,15317,Business Tour - Board Game with Online Multiplayer,"The game is terribly unfair and really picks its favorites. It always selects someone to be the ""lucky"" winner and another person to be the terribly sorry loser. I had played quite a few matches with friends and most of the time I was selected to be the loser (by the game, that is). No need to say I didn't enjoy that. It's not like I'm paranoid for thinking that - like my friends who were winning thought - it's totally the oposite, because when it was my friends' turn to be the loser, they started noticing a pattern too: some people simply have lucky rolls in this game for no reason and the same goes the other way. You don't roll physical 3D rendered dice, instead, you click a button and wait for the game to do its thing. I can't say I trust that. The rolls were so predictable, me and my friends started guessing the next rolls and we would mostly be right about it.Its pretty much random how it selects people, I was just unfortunate enough to be selected several times. Its RGN system is completely broken and who knows if that really was what the developers had in mind. If it was, I can say it was a terrible decision. It makes no sense to be like this. it's not fun as soon as you know you will lose. Who'd want to play like that? (The developers, maybe)RGN aside, this game has some other flaws, such as the trouble that we must go through if we wanna play with friends. Sometimes the Steam chat invite doesn't work, some other times it does. Some people can host rooms, some others can't (and like the winner/loser pick I just mentioned, it also changes between players). You are always designated one of the 4 random colors (red, blue, green and yellow) at the beggining of each game and can't pick your own color (but can pick between 4 different characters), which at first might not seem so bad, but when your game doesn't have a quick replay option in case you want to play again with the same settings, it gets mildly annoying to say the least. You'd have to leave the match you just finished just so you could create another one from scratch and invite your friends again. When that happens, you'll be assigned random colors again, which really messes up your brain when you want to identify your friends, based on the last match.This game is not very user friendly, but made me and some friends kill some time, but I still can't recommend. If you wanna get a good board game video game, get TABLETOP SIMULATOR. That's the definitive game in this category. Go there and play some Monopoly, whatever.

2424,8890,8894,PlanetSide 2,"Note: to see this review in its true form go to:http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/Planetside2-good.htmlPlanetside 2 is Massive Multiplayer, Free-Roam, and Free 2 Play. The Gameplay of Planetside 2 Varies. sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas. other times massive armies will attack for a large command post. Now, because Planetside 2 is a ""free to play"" game you might be wondering if the Paying players get an advantage. the answer would yes and no. Yes because paying players can get guns,armor, and upgrades faster, No because they don't get any Paid-only weapons. for example they can't drop $20/$30 and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them.Players in Planetside 2 can choose from SIX classes. Light Assault,Heavy Assault,Combat Medic,Sniper,engineer, and Mech Suit. Planetside 2 is meant to be a tactics game, and i've had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit. In Planetside 2 instead of Clans you have Outfits. now you can join a platoon without being in that Outfit, but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online.Visual-wise Planetside 2 is great, Textures are High-Res, Shadows are soft and lighting is done just right. The best part is that it doesn't take too much GPU or CPU power. The not so great part is that it only runs in 32-bit mode. Gameplay takes part on three massive open-world continents on the world Auraxis. the three continents you fight on are Indar,Esamir, and Amerish. each map has its own theme. one is icy and cold, another is warm and wet, and the last is a dry arid wasteland. The servers are normally lag-free, I've played at least 15 hours and I can only remember lagging out four times, and that was when I was in a 200+ person battle. one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other leveled up players. but this just means the noobs should team up with the veterans and provide support, like a playing as a sniper,Medic, or Engineer. another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base, and that is that most players DON'T want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in Call Of Duty shooting people in little killing sprees. thats not how this game works. and if you try to play it like Call Of Duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win.The only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line, maybe a co-op campaign. it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the devs put into the factions and areas. i guess that's asking too much for a MMO. Anyways, Check Planetside 2 out, its free,its fun, and its on steam.

2428,6768,6772,Heroes & Generals,"Quite honestly this is the worst FPS I've ever played. Extremely clunky and frustrating mechanics. The physics are just riduclously bad. You can't drive a vehicle over a railroad track, it just stops you like a brick wall. Random boulders are hidden at river crossings seemingly purposefully just to get in your way. It is so frustrating, not fun at all. Weapons are all extremely unbalanced and often get magical headshots out of nowhere. This is rage-inducing when it happens to you, and when you do it to somebody else, it's not even fun. It's just like, ""Wow, I killed that guy? Oh."" Game is also riddled with bugs.

2433,9023,9027,PlanetSide 2,"Game is very clearly Pay to Win, while indeed all non-cosmetics can be obtained 'freely' the gains for its currency are A single weapon once every twelve hours of play if you maintain the same pace of the number 1 stat earning player in the game. This doesn't include the price you have to pay for classes and vehicles to make them competitive all of which are two to three times more expensive. Paying players get significant resource advantages that allow them to pull vehicles much more often.Players are occasionally suspended for achieving scores that get deemed ""too high"" by an automated system all while legitimate hackers take days to weeks to ban due to a worthless reporting system that needs to be circumvented by on website support tickets and reddit threads.Mandatory items for some classes are locked behind very expensive loot boxes AND a tedious alert system that requires your faction to win repeatedly to level up which perhaps maybe 10-20 players on a given server have any real impact on which faction actually wins. Failure to have said items can mean the difference between a 1.2 KD and a 6.0 KDThe hit detection in the game is client based so a particularly laggy individual has an extreme advantage if they play aggressively often getting seconds of time before you can even see them to shoot at you. Individuals that use ways to artifically limit their ping or even just pulling the plug on their connection can increase that time to almost half a minute before servers will bother automatically logging them off.The Development Team actively desparages critizism of balance changes unless it is overwhelmingly positive, and have been caught on live streams suspending players for killing them while they casually play the game.

2446,5763,5767,DCS World Steam Edition,"First of all it may show I only have 2.2 hours on record but that is because I use the stand-alone version of DCS. I will still leave a review as both versions are near enough the same.First of all I see a lot of reviews, positive and negative, refering to this as a game. Even if the devs did call this a game at one point it is not strictly the case. This is nearer a professional flight simulator than it is a game. So if you are looking for an arcade flying game and not a simulator, look elsewhere.I have played DCS for a while now and I also own a fair few of its modules and I have to say I thoroughly enjoy it. It is a beautiful flight sim with an enormous amount of attention paid to detail. Not kidding, there is so much detail on certain mdules that even the circuit breakers and air vent slits are modeled. The majority of modules also come with an extremely detailed exterior and damage model and they also come with a professional flight model which makes DCS a leader in realistic combat aircraft handling characteristics. It is comparable to X-Plane 11 commercial aircraft flight models, but DCS exceeds X-plane 11 in the combat aircraft flight models. But this is just a light comparison as these two programs were made for different purposes.Now before I make my final round-up, I would like to address the reviews which complain about the prices of modules being the same as AAA games. They are that price because of the Research and Development costs which goes into those modules. As they put so much detail in their modules it takes a lot of time and money and frankly, looking at the finished products, you can see that it cost them a lot. So for those reviews saying it is not their real value, think again, for what you get is AAA game quality. You even get a frikin 500+ page manual on ALL modeled systems and combat employment for your plane/ helicopter.Final Verdict: DCS is the best combat flight simulator you can get on the market. With beautiful worlds and highly detailed modules its hard not to be impressed by it. The learning curve is huge but if you are patient enough you will get to grips with your plane and the sense of achievment you get when reaching a level of competency in your chosen module(s) is fantastic. Sure there are a few bugs here and there but it is rare nowadays to see a prgram without fault. In the end, I would recomend this to patient flight simers looking for a good combat aircraft sim and for people looking for arcady gameplay and easy learning then look somewhere else. This game is compatible with VR and being a VR user myself, it just makes it even more thrilling, especially as they are starting to add Oculus Touch support.",1, hours record use stand version dcs leave review versions near lot reviews positive negative refering game devs game point strictly case nearer professional flight simulator game looking arcade flying game simulator look played dcs fair modules thoroughly enjoy beautiful flight sim enormous attention paid detail kidding detail certain mdules circuit breakers air vent slits modeled majority modules come extremely detailed exterior damage model come professional flight model makes dcs leader realistic combat aircraft handling characteristics comparable x plane commercial aircraft flight models dcs exceeds x plane combat aircraft flight models light comparison programs different purposes final round like address reviews complain prices modules aaa games price research development costs goes modules detail modules takes lot time money frankly looking finished products cost lot reviews saying real value think aaa game quality frikin page manual modeled systems combat employment helicopter final verdict dcs best combat flight simulator market beautiful worlds highly detailed modules hard impressed learning curve huge patient grips plane sense achievment reaching level competency chosen fantastic sure bugs rare nowadays prgram fault end recomend patient flight simers looking good combat aircraft sim people looking arcady gameplay easy learning look game compatible vr vr user makes thrilling especially starting add oculus touch support

2453,7558,7562,Trove,"Trove is a classic grinding MMO, with an option to fast-forward the grinding with real money. The game is fun, the different classes lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game. The enemies balance well with the player level, and the game is paced so as to offer the player a reward at intervals that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure. One of the greatest features is the ""cornerstone""- your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome. The downside is that grinding MMO's require functional servers to enjoy, and the developers can't seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life. In the past two weeks since I began playing, with 48.5 hrs on record, there was not a day that passed  without the servers going down. Disruptions of less than an hour or 2 do not make the forum ( I think the dev's see them as common) but looking at the forum you can see that the server goes down for long periods at approximately 2 day intervals.

2458,9136,9140,PlanetSide 2,"This game is awesome for a free to play game!However, even after 6 hours,  I felt things starting to get repetitive. A lot of the bases are very similar and fighting in big battles can be really overwhelming. And you have to unlock all the guns with In-game currency which seems very difficult because of how insanely high everything was priced. You can't even drive vehicles or fly ships without having to play in-game points.On the plus side though, the scale of everything is awesome! And most importantly the guns feel good to shoot, and each class feels important. Overall I'd definitly reccomend checking it out. The gameplay is great and the game is FREAKING FREE, but once you've stormed a base, or fight in a huge battle, it feels like you've seen them all. I wish the game had more variety.

2459,3781,3784,Team Fortress 2,"Well, since I got a fair bit of playtime on this game, I think it would be time to write a real review. (Never wrote reviews before, so I'll just do some pros and cons and then my opinion).I think there is a lot of positives and negatives, so here are some of them!Pros-TF2 is for me a game of unlimited fun. I'm over 4000 hours now, and still find it just as enjoyable as first time I started up the game.-It's a good first person shooter for players who don't have a lot of experience with first person shooters. But it's also challenging for experienced gamers, because there is a lot of difrent classes, and even more difrent playstyles. -It's friendly for all ages. It's easy to pick up for smaller kids, but also holds an interest for ''older'' players.-Like in CS:GO there are also community servers, which bring even more playmodes, mods and almost difrent games to the table.Cons-The matchmaking is still not working 100% correctly. You still sometimes get in a game where it's 5 vs 10. And sometimes everybody from one team leaves, and it takes up to hours for new players to join, so in the meantime it's a really unbalanced match. -The updates are still dissapointing to me. When they come out, they are extremly poorly done, and it takes many months for the updates to get to a decent completion. Example; Meet your Match came out many months ago (I don't remember the exact date), and it has just recently in my opinion, gotten to a decent state.This game means so much to me, I've spend so so many hours in it, and none of them has been boring.I can only recommend this game!",1, got fair bit playtime game think time write real review wrote reviews pros cons think lot positives negatives game unlimited fun hours find enjoyable time started good person shooter players lot experience person shooters challenging experienced gamers lot difrent classes difrent playstyles friendly ages easy pick smaller kids holds interest older cs community servers bring playmodes mods difrent games table cons matchmaking working correctly game vs everybody team leaves takes hours new players join meantime unbalanced match updates dissapointing come extremly poorly takes months updates decent completion example meet match came months ago remember exact date recently opinion gotten decent state game means spend hours boring recommend game

2465,2477,2480,War Thunder,"War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.",0, war thunder going downhill alarming rate year recommended game years ago benefit doubt nt recommend apperently found way screw high tier br hortons matched sabers mig late war tanks fight best cold war tanks random sim mode deleted given ammo think m game playing game friends request noticed good taken notice simulator mode players catering little bit somewhat polished version ec mode looks like sticking time recorded history actually listened kept normal sim mode good old sim mode nt worse fixed aircraft rendering long ranges km wide planes viewed long ranges long range spotting way better launch better weeks ago nice stick occasional muffin piles dog patch better great idea game completely ruined greedy blind devs reasons stay away slime matchmaking bad bullet head patch cold war tanks jets able fight late war planes matchmaking completely favors russia way zero involvement community normally listening players adding think game needs game better guys nt care players anymore hired bad moderators forums straight ban people nt hail gods plenty broken promises told bomber internals years ago add single told better matchmaking year ago single shred said awesome new damage flight models fall sky wing gets scratched told game stop adding vehicles russia historical accuracy thrown window russian planes lower battleranks play lower tier planes means russian planes fight lower german allied planes like russian planes tanks way powerful actually reducing armor power planes tanks allied german forces claim propaganda good time throwing russian documents devs bad russian tanks acutally lies anti russian propaganda plenty planes stall japanese planes plenty russian planes stall wingtip stall flatspin simulator settings like flying spaceship obey laws physics favor stay far away pile ultranationalistic garbage
2466,11735,11739,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewThis is easily the worst game I've ever bought. Buggy, game decides when it allows you into the character selection screen. Sometimes on first attmept, sometimes you haveto try 10 times.The performance is awful even on a good gaming PC. Translation is a joke, ""poison"" instead of ""position""? Really? The FoV is too narrow, you have to edit the .ini file yourself for the game to use vertical FoV instead of the too narrow horizontal FoV. People are mass duping items from the AH, which obviously means totally broken economy. The ""action combat"", something they were advertising, only works with one class, Berserker, all the other classes don't have that feature. The UI is impossible, it's huge, can't edit anything.

2470,14912,14917,Robocraft,"been playing this game since early 2016. i'll agree it was a lot more fun then, but it's still decent now, and the principle is still mostly intact :). I would love to see:+ older map styles (bigger spaces so fights aren't so stationary) + protonium towers as opposed to pointholding/destruction of protonium as opposed to growth + larger player number for BA/LA. + better matchmakinggreat to have the tech tree back and the condensation of RP into robits is nice too. the biggest gripe i have with this game is the graphic design... the transition animations/rendering on certain objects look too tacky. when i first played, RC had that really relaxed, clean ""open source"" feeling, especially when i would just build robots in the garage for fun. now i feel like the graphics are... too shiny? as if they're going for that OW/Fnite feel, which is kind of awkward???? but that's a personal aesthetic opinion... and it doesn't affect gameplay at all. :-palso, right now the weapon meta is kind of weird, but given the constant nerfs and buffs in this game i hope it gets sorted out. it's not enough to make me not want to play this game either lol. TLDR: Robocraft right now is worth at least downloading. It's decent. I hope they add more old stuff and reevaluate the balance between good graphics and good game mechanics.

2471,16050,16055,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewNow, I'm probably slightly biased because I played the original ""AdventureQuest"" and ""DragonFable"" back in the day, but I truly love this game.This game is built with a centeral focus on broad accessability, both in how easy the gameplay is to pick up on (seriously, even the most novice-level gamer can master the basics of the game's combat, movement, and questing in the first hour or two of play) and the mercifully low system requirements (Don't have a dedicated gaming rig with a top-of-the-line graphics card, a solid state drive, a 3.5 gigahertz quad core CPU, and a funky liquid cooling system? No problem! This game could run smoothly on a modest netbook!). The humor is goofy, light-hearted, and full of fun pop culture references; the art style is cartoonish and vibrantly colorful; and the overall atmosphere of the game is one of fun and joy, and you can't help but smile at the goofy monsters and silly puns. It's just easy enough to get into that it serves as a fun ""chill game"" for experienced gamers between more hardcore titles, but just challenging enough that young kids and more casual gamers will get a decent challenge out of it as they learn to play their class and climb up a difficulty curve that expects players to master the game's mechanics but doesn't slam them with insane difficulty spikes out of the blue. This balance between challenge and comfort makes AQ3D basically the gaming equivalent of in-shell roasted peanuts: Delicious and satisfying, with an acceptable level of challenge to get to the good part...and the ocasional bonus nut in the shell when you least expect it.If you, like me, played the older browser games back in the day, you will feel a rush of nostalgia when running into the old, familiar cast of NPC's and will really be amazed at the job the team at Artix Entertainment did when bringing the old 2D Flash world of Lore into the Third Dimension. Sure, the graphics aren't as shiny as ""Final Fantasy XIV"" or ""Black Desert Online"" on the highest settings (the game is meant to be playable on both PC and mobile devices...with the side-effect that it's easy on older and less powerful machines too), but there's a PS2-era charm to it that just feels natural for the AQ universe. The music and sound are decent, nothing to write home about, but pleasant to the ear and situationally fitting.Character customization is simplistic: Gender, Hair Style (including main style and braided side-locks), eye color, skin color, and starting class. You can't switch your character's body type (yet...*hint**weedle*), but you can switch their class and outer appearance in-game and their gender on their character page on the game's website. The three classes you can pick in the begining are Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, but with a one-time payment of $20 you can unlock the Guardian class (which includes the class, and unlocking a new area and special armor...just like the other games in the AQ family). This being an AQ game, you can pretty much expect that down the line you'll be able to turn your character into a werewolf or vampire, and the next level of classes (and dual-wielding for rogues) are already being tried out on the game's test server. Sadly, this game does not have multiple character slots available, though...so if you're going to re-create one of your old characters from an older AQ game or an original character of yours in AQ3D, make sure you choose your favorite.The combat in this game is simple Tab-targeting, and currently you're mostly stuck fighting one guy at a time...even if more than one guy is attacking you. They are working on AOE attack capabilities, though, so that's going to be fixed eventually. As simple as the combat is, though, it's also fun, engaging, and surprisingly tactical. Learning how to play your class is key to success and survival, and woe betide the player who drops their guard while fighting regular mobs a little too close to where an elite enemy either is or is likely to spawn. No-look this game and you WILL die. A lot.As far as the community is concerned, the population is pretty healthy. You see a lot of players online all over the place, and folks are pretty friendly in this game. I'm guessing it's because there are a lot of long-time and returning AQ and DF fans playing who are now in their 20's and 30's, and it's a relatively laid-back, non-competative game overall, which breeds a more friendly and colaborative atmosphere. There are plans for some kind of PvP in the game, however...so let's hope that it's implemented in such a way that it doesn't encourage gankers to prey on low-level players or turn certain areas of the game into ""bad neighborhoods"" where you can't go 5 minutes without some over-eager brawler just spoiling for a fight popping up to bother you with an impromptu and totally unwanted duel.(Sorry if I hurt some feelings with that, but I really don't care if your king-fu is better than mine. I'm just here to grind mobs, explore the world, and hunt for treasure. Some people see the possibility of random open world PvP as incredibly fun and exciting, I just see it as an annoying interruption...like the morning alarm clock going off at the climax of an amazing dream. I want PvP players to have fun too, though. Personally, I think a karma/reputation and bounty system should exist to deal with players who like to jump out and PvP people at random all the time--too many attacks [especially on players below your level or repeated ambushes on the same player] and your karma/reputation gets so bad that there's a bounty gets placed on your head and other players can hunt you down to defeat you [with no consequences to their own karma/rep, reguardless of their level] to claim the bounty. The best part is, you can't see your karma/rep score and you and people on your Friends list can't see your name on the bounty board, so you won't know that there's a price on your head until it's too late! Once your bounty is collected, your karma/rep is reset to neutral. PvP people can still have their fun [maybe more so as a subculture of bounty hunters develops around the bounty system], and PvE people will be happy knowing that eventually that annoying ganker is going to get his.)So, yes, I recommend AQ3D. I recommend it to fans of RPG's of all kinds, I recommend it to anyone who played the AQ family of browser-based games back in the day, I recommend it to people who have never played an MMORPG before, I recommend it to hardcore players looking for a ""chill out"" title, I recommend it to people with older or less powerful machines, and I definitely recommend it to people who are young-at-heart and have a silly sense of humor. If any new MMORPG today has any hope of being a WoW-sized hit, it's AQ3D.",1, early access reviewnow probably slightly biased played original adventurequest dragonfable day truly love game game built centeral focus broad accessability easy gameplay pick seriously novice level gamer master basics game combat movement questing hour play mercifully low system requirements dedicated gaming rig line graphics card solid state drive gigahertz quad core cpu funky liquid cooling system problem game run smoothly modest netbook humor goofy light hearted fun pop culture references art style cartoonish vibrantly colorful overall atmosphere game fun joy help smile goofy monsters silly puns easy serves fun chill game experienced gamers hardcore titles challenging young kids casual gamers decent challenge learn play class climb difficulty curve expects players master game mechanics slam insane difficulty spikes blue balance challenge comfort makes basically gaming equivalent shell roasted peanuts delicious satisfying acceptable level challenge good ocasional bonus nut shell expect like played older browser games day feel rush nostalgia running old familiar cast npc amazed job team artix entertainment bringing old flash world lore dimension sure graphics shiny final fantasy xiv black desert online highest settings game meant playable pc mobile devices effect easy older powerful machines era charm feels natural aq universe music sound decent write home pleasant ear situationally fitting character customization simplistic gender hair style including main style braided locks eye color skin color starting class switch character body type switch class outer appearance game gender character page game website classes pick begining warrior mage rogue time payment unlock guardian class includes class unlocking new area special armor like games aq family aq game pretty expect line able turn character werewolf vampire level classes dual wielding rogues tried game test server sadly game multiple character slots available going create old characters older aq game original character sure choose favorite combat game simple tab targeting currently stuck fighting guy time guy attacking working aoe attack capabilities going fixed eventually simple combat fun engaging surprisingly tactical learning play class key success survival woe betide player drops guard fighting regular mobs little close elite enemy likely spawn look game die lot far community concerned population pretty healthy lot players online place folks pretty friendly game guessing lot long time returning aq df fans playing relatively laid non competative game overall breeds friendly colaborative atmosphere plans kind pvp game let hope implemented way encourage gankers prey low level players turn certain areas game bad neighborhoods minutes eager brawler spoiling fight popping bother impromptu totally unwanted hurt feelings care king fu better grind mobs explore world hunt treasure people possibility random open world pvp incredibly fun exciting annoying interruption like morning alarm clock going climax amazing dream want pvp players fun personally think karma reputation bounty system exist deal players like jump pvp people random time attacks especially players level repeated ambushes player karma reputation gets bad bounty gets placed head players hunt defeat consequences karma rep reguardless level claim bounty best karma rep score people friends list bounty board wo know price head late bounty collected karma rep reset neutral pvp people fun maybe subculture bounty hunters develops bounty system pve people happy knowing eventually annoying ganker going yes recommend recommend fans rpg kinds recommend played aq family browser based games day recommend people played mmorpg recommend hardcore players looking chill title recommend people older powerful machines definitely recommend people young heart silly sense humor new mmorpg today hope wow sized hit

About the game, its a very fun game to play, you can play with your friends locally with a lot of players, yes i said it, A LOT of player. This game actually designed to be played with many players in a single match, despite the look, it actually works so well (8-players is awesome, especially when you are having a party with your friends and you got a lot of controllers to bring, you should be fine). The gameplay is great, the UI changes a bit since the first time i play, and you can unlock every characters using in-game currency, but if you want to unlock all instantly you can get a DLC for it. Online is also great, you can play with your friends over the internet but make sure you got a good connection since this game needs a very good ping indeed (you are not gonna like it when you get hit by your opponents first before you even realize they move in the first place) and i don't really play ranked at all, im just playing for fun fyi.Very fun to play, highly recommended if you are looking for Free-to-Play brawling games that supports a lot of players at the same time, at the same PC.

2492,12106,12110,Bless Online,"I wanted to like this game, since US developers/publishers have abandoned mainline MMORPGs.PRO Summary:- Good 3D graphics- Some novelty in combat mechanics- Easy to follow quest sequences- No gender-locked classes- PvE and PvP play- Territory ownership for guildsCONs Summary- FPS stutters heavily- Messages can conceal important events- Solo play required at early levels, Dungeon teams required at higher levels- Juvneile community with poor policing - trolls, beggars and gold-sellers are common- Slow quest pacing - lots of talk, little action, with mediocre English translation and weak voice acting- No manual, nearly useless publisher-supported wikiCOMMUNITY ANGEREarly access cost $30, then game became F2P when it went live. Those who paid were enraged, and many left, leaving the game with a relatively small community. The community has very immature tendancies and comes across are not very welcoming. POOR ENGINEERINGMost developers invest a few months (before launch) refactoring the data loading and 3D system. That was not done in this game. As a result, UI inputs can have up to a 1.5 second delay, and the framerate stutters frequently. Use game default video settings and go into the capital city. Just rotate in place with a character. The rotation is full of lurches and burps, with various dropped animation frames. Similar things happen during movement and combat. No self-respecting US developer would let this out the door.INEPT GAME DESIGNQuests have ton of dull, repetitive storyline with amateurish voice acting. However, gameplay teaching quests are brief, often mysterious, and frequently lacking,  The game prohibits useful groups in the main storyline (all battles send the player into a solo instance). Even if you want to help somebody else through a difficult part in that quest, you can't. However,  after level 30 dungeons are virtually required, and you must group up for dungeons.  Not only is there no manual, but the publisher-supported wiki is hopelessly theadbare, with frequent pleas for contributions.The designers never considered how to help players recover from trouble. For example, the Paladin (healer) class faces a difficult level 4 solo battle. The battle is nearly impossible to win unless you use all the new tactics and skills you just got a bit earlier in that quest when you graduated to level 4. Never mind that the announcements can happen in the middle of another fight, and obscure what's happening in the 3D world.  You must win that fight to continue the main quest and the game. Finishing a quest is 5,000+ XP, while killing monsters is 8 XP, so don't try to bypass the mainline quest by kill-grinding.  There are many similar quests which you have just one chance to succeed. After that, the quest is marked as a failure - permanently.This appears again at level 6. You're given some free single-use scrolls to learn how the (undocumented) pet training interface works. by trial and error.  If you err too much, you run out of scrolls. Can you get more scrolls? Can you restart the quest? Nope to both - quest just remains in your list, uncompleted, for eternity.  If you visit the quest giver, they just issue wordy taunts to you.  TL;DRThis game had betas in Russia and Korea, which both failed (the servers were shut down). Neowiz top management made a few changes without understanding the real issues, did cheap translations and voice-overs in English, and did some bone-headed marketing. Of course the game is unpleasant to play.",0, wanted like game developers publishers abandoned mainline mmorpgs pro good novelty combat easy follow quest gender locked pve pvp territory ownership guildscons fps stutters messages conceal important solo play required early levels dungeon teams required higher juvneile community poor policing trolls beggars gold sellers slow quest pacing lots talk little action mediocre english translation weak voice manual nearly useless publisher supported wikicommunity angerearly access cost game went live paid enraged left leaving game relatively small community community immature tendancies comes welcoming poor engineeringmost developers invest months launch refactoring data loading system game result ui inputs second delay framerate stutters frequently use game default video settings capital city rotate place character rotation lurches burps dropped animation frames similar things happen movement combat self respecting developer let door inept game designquests ton dull repetitive storyline amateurish voice acting gameplay teaching quests brief mysterious frequently lacking game prohibits useful groups main storyline battles send player solo instance want help somebody difficult quest level dungeons virtually required group dungeons manual publisher supported wiki hopelessly theadbare frequent pleas contributions designers considered help players recover trouble example paladin healer class faces difficult level solo battle battle nearly impossible win use new tactics skills got bit earlier quest graduated level mind announcements happen middle fight obscure happening world win fight continue main quest game finishing quest xp killing monsters xp try bypass mainline quest kill grinding similar quests chance succeed quest marked failure permanently appears level given free single use scrolls learn undocumented pet training interface works trial error err run scrolls scrolls restart quest nope quest remains list uncompleted eternity visit quest giver issue wordy taunts game betas russia korea failed servers shut neowiz management changes understanding real issues cheap translations voice overs english bone headed marketing course game unpleasant play
2493,10906,10910,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI can't help feeling that I've played games that executed everything better while I'm playing this game.I hate to make comparisons, but it was so goddamn easy to do while I was trying out the campaign. When I was dead drawing resources, I kept on flashing back to Spellweaver and how eloquent it made the resource management aspect. When I saw the ability to permanently modify cards you didn't even have in hand, Hex did it better, and made it so ubiquitous and fun that it became the defining feature of that game. It also has this Hearthstone design and vibe with how quick everything is supposed to be and how gameplay ramps, but then again Hearthstone already does that (and Shadowverse does it way better).Nothing felt particularly interesting about this game. I've spent so little time with it, yet I felt like I've seen everything it had to offer in the tutorial, and I've seen it done better everywhere else. I felt motivated to leave a non-recommendation in just half an hour, and not out of the fact that any part of it is bad, but that it was so tepid and lackluster that I couldn't understand why the game had such a positive review score at the time.Just, why?I have to come back and comment even more. Why have land draws that can do absolutely nothing to advance your game? I don't get it. That's the most luck based mechanic ever devised; drawing something, your only avenue of increasing your choices; that can be completely dead, yet necessary to your game. Every game after Magic tried to avoid that, and Eternal runs headfirst into it. Even when Hex did it, they at least gave you charges for a hero power so you were building up to something.",0, early access reviewi help feeling played games executed better playing game hate comparisons goddamn easy trying campaign dead drawing resources kept flashing spellweaver eloquent resource management aspect saw ability permanently modify cards hand hex better ubiquitous fun defining feature game hearthstone design vibe quick supposed gameplay ramps hearthstone shadowverse way felt particularly interesting game spent little time felt like seen offer tutorial seen better felt motivated leave non recommendation half hour fact bad tepid lackluster understand game positive review score time come comment land draws absolutely advance game luck based mechanic devised drawing avenue increasing choices completely dead necessary game game magic tried avoid eternal runs headfirst hex gave charges hero power building

2510,7140,7144,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"player from Direwolf days (beta and early or so.) If you are smart and browse Steam reviews only reading the negative ones to get actual non-sponsored opinions, this re-visit impression is for you.Stay away from this game, it looks like Bethesda is no longer making any money with this one and dont have the decency to can it, rather opting to syphon the existing fan base of as much as possible and kill it slowly. Hence the decision to pass it off to Shitpants or whatever this company is called, 99% chance you never heard of and YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHY. You can tell from the name alone what their priorities are.At the moment it looks like they are full-stop converting the game to exclusively P2W/P2P, if that, possibly P2L at this point like is trending right now among mobile-type casual games and are making ♥♥♥♥ed up choices to the already questionable balance, possibly only releasing cards that have been pre-made for them, impossible to imagine this new company will produce any new content themselves (I mean just look at their ♥♥♥♥ed up website and repertoire of ""mobile masterpieces,"" looks like a malware distributor that you end up at if you click on a wrong link accidentally.)ES:L was kind of charming at it's inception, it wasn't very balanced and fairly P2W but kind of generous compared to HS for example. There was some illusion and even possibility to play it daily even F2P and get somewhere, perhaps a little money here and there. The fanbase for these games sucks and this was understood, so they had to make a lot more aggro style cards for them and add more RNG elements to give them a chance (and to copy HS, which is all this game was at the end of the day, a genuine attempt at a decent HS clone/competitor) but it was tolerable. Some of the YT and content creators were cool and enthusiastic, rather than just phoning it in for Amazon giftcards or whatever.  Despite it's flaws it had an endearing Bethesda quality to it of circa 2010~/Skyrim era and a couple of cool ideas/designs and it was possible to have fun and interesting matches now and again. While some of that may still be there for the time, it's clear that the corporates have decided that it's past it's prime and you won't find any redeeming qualities left here before too long. It may see another expansion if one has already been made ahead of time, but even that seems like a stretch at this point considering how long it's been since the last one.",0, player direwolf days beta early smart browse steam reviews reading negative ones actual non sponsored opinions visit impression stay away game looks like bethesda longer making money nt decency opting syphon existing fan base possible kill slowly decision pass shitpants company called chance heard guess tell priorities moment looks like stop converting game exclusively possibly point like trending right mobile type casual games making ed choices questionable balance possibly releasing cards pre impossible imagine new company produce new content mean look ed website repertoire mobile masterpieces looks like malware distributor end click wrong link l kind charming inception balanced fairly kind generous compared hs example illusion possibility play daily little money fanbase games sucks understood lot aggro style cards add rng elements chance copy hs game end day genuine attempt decent hs clone competitor tolerable yt content creators cool enthusiastic phoning amazon giftcards despite flaws endearing bethesda quality circa era couple cool ideas designs possible fun interesting matches time clear corporates decided past prime wo find redeeming qualities left long expansion ahead time like stretch point considering long

2516,2798,2801,War Thunder,"I'm trying to write a review somewhat base on my experience. For playing almost 3 yrs grinding with the Germans, Americans, British and the Japanese but not the Russians because i don't have the time and interest.Whether is tanks or aircrafts each faction has its own ups and downs. However every battle i jump into, the Russian will win often whether is alone or joint with other factions. Maybe it could be map design or people complaining about broken MM(Match-making),FM(flight model) and many things in the game if you read the forums in the communitiy. For the most important part is that i refuse to believe ""Russian Bias"". You can win by communicating to team, best played with a friend through Skype or Teamspeak. It takes skills and observation in the battlefield and knowing the weakspots of your enemy. But now due to recent updates and horrible fixes of the game it became somewhat unbalanced mostly Match making and the graphical glitches where you see your enemies behind a wall or bushes when you are not aiming your gun sight. Sometimes the hit detection doesn't inform you whether you make a confirm hit of the target or not. Not to mention the amour physics can be a bit whackky.

2522,6263,6267,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewI played this game a LOT when it first came out and I loved it, I loved being a commander sending in troops to help with the war, I loved sniping, flanking, finding different routes to the objective and adjusting my guns through the money gained each match.2 years on I went back to the game.... I wish I hadn't. The commander mode i enjoyed was now gated under high ranks I would never achieve (i liked to log in play an hour or two as commander and then go do something else) so now I won't be able to help in the war effort by sending troops in. The progression has been slowed right down to where you NEED the premium (which you pay for) to get anywhere and even then it's still slow going.The game itself seems to have gone backwards in gameplay and the menu system is... awful. good luck finding anything quickly if your new or coming back to the game after a long period away.

So you gotta figure out th rest by yourself. You can look up what the upgrades do and figure out what the tower itself does from there. No idea where to look up what bloons do. While playing, you are slowly getting there but it's nothing for people with low patience as myself I guess.You get thrown into multiplayer with people who seem to know much more than you do and thus they win while you don't know what their towers are doing or how to counter it. I think you have to lose some matches before you are able to win (or jsut be extremely lucky). If you like, you can buy stronger towers right away via microtransactions. Maybe you have better chances of winning then.The UI is a bit confusinng, but I guess that's because it's for moblie.

2540,12075,12079,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewI have almost 20hrs in. While the revoews are mostly negative, these are from people who expect a perfect MMO release. That is not a realistic hope. The game does have some issues(stuck at loading screen), these issues have work arounds and are actively being looked into, there is some performance issues some people claim to have. I did not expierence them. But for people that are, you can tweak config file to improve them. This has almost become standard with alot of MMO releases. I have found a few spots in the game where the translation was not carried over correctly. These can make trying to understand the quest hard, but its also a port from another lanquage and that can cause alot of issues and somethings dont always translate over correctly. But, Even with those issues the game is still really gorgious world around you. The gameplay so far I have really enjoyed. and the storyline even with its issues still does intice me to listen. The Pvp is fun, the dungeons are fun as well. And the questing I enjoyed(which I normally hate with a passion), So For 30$ its worth the money.. Its been awhile since a game has caught my attention for more than a day or so. I have played Wow-13yrs, AOC-1yr,EQ1 & Eq2- 3+yrs, ESO 2months, BDO 2 days.

2550,13599,13603,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewRight, I've tried to like this game. I've got a significant playtime on a server with friends. I'm being as unbiased as I can. If Minecraft didn't exist, perhaps Creativerse would look better. As it is, by basing so much of its core gameplay off of Minecraft, it really has no excuse to be this mediocre. This game is Minecraft Lite. It's Minecraft made simple, with a lot of pretty blocks and cute ""pets"", but basically nothing more. It's Minecraft for the unambitious, the unimaginative. It's what you'd let your child play, if you thought she couldn't handle challenge or failure. In the process of lowering the learning curve, Creativerse takes away the cool toys and leaves you with limits. No complicated redstone, instead have a wiring system that gets confused when you send two inputs into an object. No world-manipulation capabilities like pistons or dispensers; instead have logic gates made for you as individual blocks, and only the ability to turn off lights and open doors with wiring. No large-scale crop and animal farming, instead mine every individual crop. Instead, feed/wash/harvest every individual animal, which you must also tame individually as it tries to escape or kill you. No risky death where your inventory falls into lava, instead respawn on this Touchstone, which you can reclaim from anywhere in the world, place anywhere, and teleport to anytime.Redstone and world-manipulation was the lifeblood of Minecraft; the ability to change every block of the world was one thing, but the ability to make the world change at the push of a button, to imagine contraptions and make them so, that is why Minecraft is timeless and so full of potential. There is no potential in Creativerse. The game-makers think for you, and the player is limited by the makers' imagination as a result. Hell, there isn't even rails or minecarts. ""Early Access"" is no excuse. In the time that this game has been in development, Minecraft went from Alpha to retail, complete with all of the core gameplay that gave the player so many possibilities. Creativerse can't add more fundamental gameplay aspects without overhauling the game, so the future will likely bring only more pretty blocks and cute pets and nothing else.In other words, if you've experienced half of what Minecraft allows you to do, then this game will make you very sad.",0, early access reviewright tried like game got significant playtime server friends unbiased minecraft exist creativerse look better basing core gameplay minecraft excuse mediocre game minecraft lite minecraft simple lot pretty blocks cute pets basically minecraft unambitious unimaginative let child play thought handle challenge failure process lowering learning curve creativerse takes away cool toys leaves limits complicated redstone instead wiring system gets confused send inputs object world manipulation capabilities like pistons dispensers instead logic gates individual blocks ability turn lights open doors wiring large scale crop animal farming instead individual crop instead feed wash harvest individual animal tame individually tries escape kill risky death inventory falls lava instead respawn touchstone reclaim world place teleport anytime redstone world manipulation lifeblood minecraft ability change block world thing ability world change push button imagine contraptions minecraft timeless potential potential creativerse game makers think player limited makers imagination result hell rails minecarts early access excuse time game development minecraft went alpha retail complete core gameplay gave player possibilities creativerse add fundamental gameplay aspects overhauling game future likely bring pretty blocks cute pets words experienced half minecraft allows game sad

This is a game which has taken strives to create a realistic simulation of a real hunting experience.You start by designing your character and signing up for another source of lifelong emails. The game allows you to explore the entire reservation and hunt rabbits and mule deals. The are other players to interact with and If you're wanting to upgrade to the full experience, you will have to purchase the proper license. Beware, your steam coins will start jingling. So that begs the question. Is it worth it?The game's graphics are very up to date and beyond beautiful. On the highest settings I see a game that completely is devoted to simulating a real hunting experience. The sounds are crisp with extreme attention to detail. Animals have real sounds, branches break with a real crispiness. The guns are real with a big verity of gadgets and equipment to use on your hunt. Although the experience is totally immersive, the free version is a little more like a demo. The limitations of only being able to hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits really make the free version become old quick. There are a lot of expansions and editions, but reviewing strictly the free portion it is beautiful but limited. If you're looking for a genuine hunting simulator, I totally recommend it.

2602,12886,12890,Fallout Shelter,"**TLDR: requires lots of work, not fun at all, poorly made, exists only as a vehicle for microtransactionsFallout Shelter started as a typical BS ""freemium"" game, made for mobile phones.  The mobile game market is aimed at those who are susceptbile to addiction, and the games exploit players in a way very similar to gambling.  There are lots of slot-machine-like sounds, and visual stimuli for completing milestones and objectives.  Payouts are randomized to encourage habitual attention.  Unlike gambling though, you'll never get money back out of it.The game is also a grindfest, making you perform tedious tasks, and wait for long periods of time.  The waiting times gradually increase, eventually getting to as much as 2 WEEKS to complete tasks.  That's 14 days of real-world time.  For example, it would take 1 dweller with decent stats 2 weeks to make one top-level weapon.  The reason it's so difficult to accomplish anything is simple: if you make players feel impatient, the most addicted players will pay real money to advance toward their goals.The gameplay mechanics are severely broken.  The combat is sluggish, and not interactive in any significant way.  The ""mysterious stranger"" random events are frequently interrupted by incident events, which automatically move the camera away from the Where's Waldo 5-second mini game, which by the way is already almost impossible due to the time limit.Games like this are not made to be fun.  They're made to exploit players.If you play this, expect to check in for a few minutes at a time, while you essentially babysit the game all day.  Every day.  Forever.  It's more of an obligation than an actual game.They could easily make it more fun by reducing the requirements to complete objectives, or by speeding up combat, or adding V.A.T.S. to combat, or by increasing the variety of activities available.

2608,14347,14352,Shop Heroes,"It seems to me there are two good ways to handle real money transactions in a ""free to play"" timer game like Shop Heroes and other timer-based games (Fallout Shelter, Realm Grinder, Adventure Capitalist, etc.):  1) allow players to use real money to purchase costumes, pets, and other flair that does not affect the gameplay; and/or 2) allow players to use real world currency to speed up timers, and allow players to progress more quickly.   Shop Heroes does both of these things. Unfortunately, Shop Heroes also handles real money transactions in a third way: it prevents players from accessing certain key workers (and the achievements associated with these workers) unless they pony up real money.  It is worth noting that these key workers are extremely expensive ($40 or $50 each), and that there is no way to unlock them with either of the in-game currencies.  Had I known that before I started, I would never have downloaded or installed the game.  But I just discovered it, and I immediately uninstalled the game (despite 1300+ hours of investment).  If you are looking for a few hours of clicking, Shop heroes is fine.  But, if you're going to take the game seriously, please take note that you won't be able to access the whole game unless you pony up almost a hundred bucks.

PROSVery entertainingSimple learning curve if your new to the genreFun community and you make friends quite easilyControls are simple yet perfectHigh replay valueMany different classes to choose from with there own unique items and skillsYou get to run in hordes of players you don't even know exploring a dungeon (and I mean TONS of people)There's a server specifically for tradingFun playing solo or with friendsDepending on how you view it: Very rewarding but also very punishing (Perma-Death)Extremely fun boss fights. I mean legit your fighting a GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING PUPPET thats like hella op with you + 50 people and the fight still takes a couple minutes.---CONSMoney. All they want is your money. Basically your bombarded with ads and ""deals"" everytime you open the game. Also, the hub is legit full of items to buy but cost like $1-$15 EVEN THOUGH you can easily with the right tools earn them IN-GAME. Don't worry, you don't need to buy these items at all/spend money in general. But one thing I'd recommend buying if you enjoy the game is the New Player Starter Pack. To sum it up, new players have 7 days (1 week) to buy this starter pack or you won't get the offer ever again. It's definitely worth getting it. It's $20 but if you were to buy all the items/vault chests/coins each, it would cost you around $80. So it's worth a buy.The game was abandoned. The developers do not update the game anymore, so no new content will be added to the game.Scammers. ""But wait, you just said RotMG had a great commu-"" Shut up. I know what I said, and it really does have a great community, But everyday more and more scammers come to the game so it gets a little hard to trade with someone when your like ""I'll give you 8 Defence Pots for 1 Life Pot"" and they're like ""Nah dude big scam big scam, you give me 16 Def Pots and I'll give you 2 Mana Pots"" like that ♥♥♥♥♥ gay.But overall, if you are planning to spend money on this game, I don't recommend it. But, if you are going to f2p this game like it was originally supposed to be, sure, give this game a quick try.",1, alright ladies gentlemen time tell decently okay story review realm mad god begin like somethings game perma death items vault decieved measly play hours probably started playing steam rotmg website prosvery entertainingsimple learning curve new genrefun community friends easilycontrols simple perfecthigh replay valuemany different classes choose unique items skillsyou run hordes players know exploring dungeon mean tons server specifically tradingfun playing solo friendsdepending view rewarding punishing perma fun boss fights mean legit fighting giant ing puppet s like hella op people fight takes couple want money basically bombarded ads deals everytime open game hub legit items buy cost like easily right tools earn game worry need buy items spend money general thing recommend buying enjoy game new player starter pack sum new players days week buy starter pack wo offer definitely worth getting buy items vault chests coins cost worth buy game abandoned developers update game anymore new content added game scammers wait said rotmg great shut know said great community everyday scammers come game gets little hard trade like defence pots life pot like nah dude big scam big scam def pots mana pots like gay overall planning spend money game recommend going game like originally supposed sure game quick try

2616,7139,7143,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"REVIEW UPDATED!First impression:Kinda mixed about this one... While it's definitely better than Hearthstone aka RNJesus-stone, it's kinda worse than Magic the Gathering. So... I'll rate this as neither a great nor a bad game to get.Second Thoughts:Edit: Thoughts behind the rating below.FINAL RATING:This game looked promising to begin with. (first impression was mixed with a rating of 4.75/10) Although it had some positive elements, the reviewer can't really state that he is impressed by the game and its core elements. The collection is ok, but nothing is impressive to any degree. This feels like another game to be forgotten within the next couple of months... the only positive element is the graphics, which prevent the inevitable 0.0/10 rating... this time!I rate this game as 3.5/10, which means that I strongly advice people not to play this game - even though it's free-to-play. It's simply not worth it, there are better alternatives.1) Gameplay: 1.0 / 3.5The two-lane system is by no means unique, MMDOC had a three-lane system and it still failed in the long run due to yolo expansions coming out. ES: L has some balance, yet the card-pool is very limited at the moment. (-0.5) and the majority of the effects are hijacked from other ccg's. It's inevitable, but still a point to consider while creating a game. (-1.5) As I have collected ~70 % of the baseset, it becomes increasingly depressing to watch, so... -0,5. This start to look very much like Hearthstone... unfortunately, but it is nevertheless true.2) Graphics / Aesthetics: 2.5 / 3.0The graphics of ES: L are very well-crafted, although I have only played this game for a very limited period of time. The voice-over is adequate, but a bit tiresome in the long run... so (-1.0) for that one. At least the animations are much better than Hearthstone's an extra (+0.5) from that aspect.3) Uniqueness: 0.0 / 1.5My apologies to all ES players, but this game is by no means a unique game in the ccg-genre. (and no, those ""prophecies"" just simply don't make the cut, my friends) Nothing else to say compared to Magic the Gathering. (you all knew it was coming anyway, so I'll leave it there...)4) Replayability: 0.00 / 2.0As with all games, replayability is important if you want to keep the playerbase at a decent size. I fear that this game doesn't have that much to offer atm. If you want a casual ccg with RNG as a major factor, then you should turn to Hearthstone, while the grand old ccg Magic the Gathering has everything that suits a grand strategist's needs. So (-1.5) from these considerations.But I still have some faith in the future development of this game... so if the developers are aware of the competitive ccg's out there, they might increase the replayability-value for ES: L through several tweaks. This thought gives a slight bonus, as I'm currently in a good mood. (+0.25)Update: Nope, the starting hand size is a joke and game-deciding. As the ring... so unfortunately I have to give -0,75 for this.",0, review impression kinda mixed definitely better hearthstone aka rnjesus stone kinda worse magic gathering rate great bad game second thoughts edit thoughts rating final rating game looked promising begin impression mixed rating positive elements reviewer state impressed game core elements collection ok impressive degree feels like game forgotten couple months positive element graphics prevent inevitable rating rate game means strongly advice people play game free play simply worth better gameplay lane system means unique mmdoc lane system failed long run yolo expansions coming es l balance card pool limited moment majority effects hijacked ccg inevitable point consider creating game collected baseset increasingly depressing watch start look like hearthstone unfortunately graphics aesthetics graphics es l crafted played game limited period time voice adequate bit tiresome long run animations better hearthstone extra uniqueness apologies es players game means unique game ccg genre prophecies simply cut friends compared magic gathering knew coming leave replayability games replayability important want playerbase decent size fear game offer atm want casual ccg rng major factor turn hearthstone grand old ccg magic gathering suits grand strategist needs considerations faith future development game developers aware competitive ccg increase replayability value es l tweaks thought gives slight bonus currently good mood nope starting hand size joke game deciding ring unfortunately

Instead of fixing this, they attempt to bring in more players by adding more♥♥♥♥♥♥ which just makes the grind longer, and pushes ol players like me away.

2620,12146,12150,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewHorrible launch, Very disappointed at their network engineers & their outlook on have a solid optimization plan in effect. While i understand that you can not predict everything & launch being critical at ironing out the presenting issues of massive connections, you can tell that the framework theyre using can not sustain the large player base. This is an issue of UE3 at its core & the framework they present to work along with the build of the game. There is a reason proper made games focus on their netcode firstly, take notice if they will have to reconstruct the game engine or build one from scratch. All of these issues are as bright a day to see for everyone as a developer & someone who tinkers with UE. Aside from what ive said earlier, the game is still meh. I've played JP,KR,RU Bless. All of which still present to me that they have not even taken seriously to build their game enviornment. Basic shaders,Basic materials & assets. Almost feels like they've made this game with the ""Blueprint"" design feature UE offers and not a object-oriented,omponent-oriented language. The game enviornment feels empty and just basic, as if someone just placed assets all over the world with no care and thats it. Skill usage still feels very basic.... Although I would say much better than before the Rebuild of the game. UI Clunky & cheap feelings, almost as if the UI is still a prototype. Such an awesome take on the mount system, yet they mess it up with having a stamina system. Stamina goes down very quick, jumping kills it so fast its ridiculous. I dont know what the devs were thinking when they introduced this, especially with the world being so big. Quality of skins,effects & costumes isn't so bad, i enjoyed it.Not much content to do really. Dungeons or Monster quest killing is just about all youre really going to be doing. Besides PvP being end game, which by the way, i dont see be enjoyable with such performance and network issues. Over all, This game is still so incomplete... I would consider the state of this game Alpha to Pre-Alpha... Bless, After all the issues you have had, you should be letting us play this game for free, You should provide us with proof that your game is in a better state rather than charging us for packs. Pure Sillyness. I wasn't going to buy this game at all but i said why the heck not, let me give the devs a chance, Well, i did & steam has now REFUNDED me. This game is not worth 30 or 40 dollars. I would say these issues wouldnt be too bad with a free release & let us test the game for you.

2621,2544,2547,War Thunder,"nice graphics for a free simulation. that's all that there is to it.now the negative points in short: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mods/supprters/developers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ premium (as in op and expensive as hell) and buggy as hell. it gets worse with every update and gaijin seems to care less and less.details:-♥♥♥♥♥♥ community: friendly fire is the war thunder way to say hello. also you have to pay for the repairs yourself. also you can't disable friendly fire. also, reporting friendly firing teammates will make your team a lot weaker than it already is after all the quitters left. also there is no way of joining a normal game later. so you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed if you have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your team. i usually have 2.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay: wow, cool, as if camping and sniping for hours without end in other games wasn't boring enough, you can now do it in a tank that takes 5-60 seconds to reload after every shot depending on how ♥♥♥♥ed you are. mother♥♥♥♥ing yay.yay king of the hill mode, like i haven't seen that one before. yay domination, something new. yay, there is literally nothing interesting in this game, except if you like to drive 10 mins with a tank at 15mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one-shot.also: one shots. you'll get one-shot all over the place, doesn't matter if the enemy is right in front of you or a mile away. you'll get one-shot through buildings, the floor, debris, dead tanks, and even ricochet from a friendly unit.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance: t34 best tank in the world. world war winning tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo. nuff said. the russian bias is real - who would've thought it, it's a russian game after all.interestingly gaijin writes about tanks at level 1.0 (""battke ranking"") that are able to deal with tanks at level 3 (which is true). but they dont change the level of that tank. nope. seems about right.also tank levels seem to change with every day passing and depending even of game type you're playing, but you cannot look up the real facts, when that very tank has what level, so that after you made a decent team and joined a game, you see that the levels are all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly has one very high level member and you now have to fight other players that have way stronger units, not as if one-shotting wasn't a huge issue anyway, now you cant even retaliate.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ supporters/mods/developers: there is actually a forum where you can post all your bug reports just to have them ignored. yay. each update comes with new bugs. yay. old ones rarely get fixed. nay.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ premium: how about you pay a ♥♥♥♥♥on of money to get great units to fight real♥♥♥♥♥♥ones? great, isn't it? you're invincible and can one-shot everybody for some cash. also, you can buy the whole game for millions of dollers. awesome. some people actually grind all the stuff for years on end. yeah, ♥♥♥♥ them, amirite gaijinalso who the ♥♥♥♥ came up with these ideas:spawning points are not possible to get artillerized, but can very well can get bombed.airplanes should start out being built out of wood, so that you catch on fire the first 100 times you fly it until you have researched the last def-upgrade. same applies for tanks, except there you can't upgrade you def normally, but fire extinguishers aren't available from the start either. also you cant repair your tank from the start either, everything has to be researchedyou can help your squadmate repair, but not your other teammates. it's also not possible to repair a tank if you havent made that specific upgrade, even if your squad mate has the same tank as you do and is around to help but you cant start repairing.fires cant be put out under wateryour crew drowns literally in 3 secondsmaps usually look like each team just came from their respective base to the battle, still you start out with tanks all over the place, srsly, noone drives a tank backwards to battle, not even the ai, not even 90° tilted. also you spawn on/in eachother which gaijin only could solve by making your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn - great, but useless against all spawnkillers and ""traffic jams"" at game start.if your tank's tires/chain is damaged your crew immediately refurse any orders for a second and stop driving to start repairing it asap. nice feature, right? nope, you cant hide like this from enemy fire, you cant put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire. you'll have to wait 4 seconds to be able to do anything. also, crew doesn't give a damn if literally everything else is destroyed, but hell brakes loose if the chain is loose.killing ai will not give you any points whatsoever for researching your already very weakly starting new units, so that it's even more of a pain to try and use new units. also, most matches have like 50% ai, which makes for very boring , since not very intelligent, play.the greatest pros have to face the greatest noobs. fact, how else are they going to sustain their high rating?""this game aint a game, it's a simulation"" - gaijin. the only thing that differentiates it from other games like world of tanks, (except everything mentioned) are (the very unrealistic battles (jk, but it's true)) sim battles that noone ♥♥♥♥ing plays for many reasons that i'm not going to get into. there is a lot else i dont want to get into, too, but i think i'm exceeding the character count.would i recommend this game?have you read my review?
