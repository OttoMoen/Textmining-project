2,14160,14165,Infestation: The New Z,"Infestation | The NewZBefore you read, i would like to say that i have over 300 hours on this game before steam release.Infestation | The NewZ, is an official rework of the original (and bad) title Infestation | Survivor Stores, formerly known as The WarZ, The NewZ is being worked on by a whole new development team called Fredaikis AB, There is not a single dev from the original ISS on this development team.Everyone knows The WarZ and how bad the game was. It was riddled with hackers, It was SERIOUSLY pay to win, loot was rare, so it made hackers even more populated, It was full of bugs that devs did not patch, and lets be honest... there was no content. All there was to do is PVP.Now... on the other hand, Fredaikis AB, the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did, They are listening to the community, and trying their best to make a game that you guys want. They have released an anticheat called MLG anticheat, THIS anticheat was designed JUST for this game, I have over 300 hours before steam and i have only got cheated ONCE. I repeat ONCE.Due to the lack of content the previous game had, they made about 10 different PVP server maps, so you can hop into it and PVP right away, they made a custom BR, They added airdrops, (these drop about every hour) on official servers, They have revamped the UI, they have added ALOT of guns that the original ISS did not have. and armor,helmets etc. AND THEY ADDED SKINS <3 Traders dream! They have completely removed the Pay 2 win aspect of the game, now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market. They have not removed (GC) Gold credits, you can use this to purchase a private server to loot, or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place. THIS IS JUST TO SUPPORT THIS GAME AND KEEP IT ALIVE.Some of you guys need to understand, they need to have a few things they can make money off of. A game is not free, they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that 10,000 people are playing on.",1, infestation newzbefore read like hours game steam release infestation newz official rework original bad title infestation survivor stores known warz newz worked new development team called fredaikis ab single dev original iss development team knows warz bad game riddled hackers seriously pay win loot rare hackers populated bugs devs patch lets honest content hand fredaikis ab team game great job correcting errors past development team listening community trying best game guys want released anticheat called mlg anticheat anticheat designed game hours steam got cheated repeat lack content previous game different pvp server maps hop pvp right away custom br added airdrops drop hour official servers revamped ui added alot guns original iss armor helmets etc added skins traders dream completely removed pay win aspect game kill zombies players buy single thing market removed gc gold credits use purchase private server loot buy premium buy skins market place support game guys need understand need things money game free need sort money pay servers people playing

11,4198,4202,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"Okay for starters this is not Yu-gi-oh. And with that being said, I both enjoy and loathe this game. Also the pay wall doesn't personally bother me too much because I grew up playing card games.What you need to know: 1. Twenty card decks rule the game, and these decks are usually loaded with the best traps and spells money can buy. So if you play this game pick a card box with the best spell and trap cards in it and keep using your free gems on those boxes until you have two or three copies of said cards. Pro tip, reset set the box after you pull the cards you're going after.2. You'll see the top meta decks so many times that you'll beg to see some originality... Lol, you'll never escape this, even in unranked.3. Farm Mai for Amazonian cards because Amazonian decks can be mostly built from card drops. Amazonian decks are pretty powerful, even in ranked.  You can also get solid plant/water cards from the card trader. (Google this for more info)4. The game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyIMAO:1. Honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.2. Deck sizes should be increased to 30 minimum3. Card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the F2P Ultra Rare card discrepancy.4. I could list more serious problems caused by Konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things I hate the most about the game.In closing, IF I SEE ONE MORE FULLY LOADED BLUE EYES DECK I'M GOING TO VOMIT!",0, okay starters yu gi oh said enjoy loathe game pay wall personally bother grew playing card games need know card decks rule game decks usually loaded best traps spells money buy play game pick card box best spell trap cards free gems boxes copies said cards pro tip reset set box pull cards going meta decks times beg originality lol escape farm mai amazonian cards amazonian decks built card drops amazonian decks pretty powerful ranked solid plant water cards card trader google game alot connection issues end match honestly play game risk designed spend deck sizes increased card boxes need fewer trash monsters better spells traps cards balance ultra rare card list problems caused konami gameplay general things hate game closing fully loaded blue eyes deck going vomit

18,2166,2169,Path of Exile,"At the time of the review I have about 700 hours logged on steam version. Path of Exile is  a hardcore action RPG with a lot of depth. It will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers. However, this game is absolutely fantastic. Pros and cons can be subjective, so I'll just point out main points.-Hardcore. Can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals. Not recommended for your first ARPG.-Free-to-play but not pay-to-win. GGG's microtransaction system is very fair. Almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in microtransaction store gives anyone an advantage.-Realistic gritty graphics. I personally love the graphic and art style, but it is highly subjective.-Music varies from ""meh"" to absolute blasts. From boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies. -Sound design is pretty solid. Good voice acting and realistic sounds.-Support is great and quick. I personally had great time using it.-Game has classes, however, the class only changes how your character looks and from where he/she starts from the skill tree.-Characters can use any skills or items if they have required stats. Skills are skill gems that can be socketed in to items.-Ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree. You can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided. Skill tree consists of little upgrades (For example, 0.3% life regeneration or 12% more physical damage.)Some people don't like this, but those small upgrades stack fast, I personally love the freedom of the skill tree.-Game is based on leagues, so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new things.-Lot of equipment variance, you can find, buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple ones.-Trading is decent but should be worked on. You either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party websites to make trades. Game has no auction houses or player shops in-game.-Leveling can be quick or slow, depending on build and skill. Max level is 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10-15 hours.-The game has 3 difficulties, Normal, Cruel and Merciless. You will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline. Story currently is composed of 3 acts (4th one is coming soon) and you complete those acts in each difficulty. This can be very boring, since it can feel like the game is repeating.-The endgame is a map system. You can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs. I personally love this system, since it offers a lot of variance, varying difficulties and different experiences.-The D-sync (Should be fixed in the Awakening expansion). Basically, you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen. This can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration, but should be getting fixed soon. (Only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game. Glad to see it going)I might have forgotten some main points...Overall, I think Path of Exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and I recommend it whole heartedly.Edit: Now at over 3k total and the Atlas of Worlds expansion is fantastic.",1, time review hours logged steam version path exile hardcore action rpg lot depth likely suited lot gamers game absolutely fantastic pros cons subjective point main heaven hardcore gamers nightmare casuals recommended play pay win ggg microtransaction system fair cosmetics microtransaction store gives gritty graphics personally love graphic art style highly varies meh absolute blasts boring lullabies beautiful symphonies design pretty solid good voice acting realistic great quick personally great time classes class changes character looks starts skill use skills items required stats skills skill gems socketed flexible huge skill tree thousands possibly millions builds tree provided skill tree consists little upgrades example life regeneration physical people like small upgrades stack fast personally love freedom skill based leagues different leagues create new character try new equipment variance find buy craft items perfect build multiple decent worked need yell chat use party websites trades game auction houses player shops quick slow depending build skill max level reach level game difficulties normal cruel merciless difficulty completing storyline story currently composed acts coming soon complete acts difficulty boring feel like game endgame map system craft mods maps fit build needs personally love system offers lot variance varying difficulties different d sync fixed awakening expansion basically sync game different position character screen probably cause lot deaths frustration getting fixed soon thing caused frustration game glad forgotten main points overall think path exile fantastic game fantastic company recommend heartedly edit total atlas worlds expansion fantastic

23,4042,4046,Team Fortress 2,"There are a number of qualities about this game that make it endearing, even to long-time players of FPS games.  It does have a very stylized look (cartoon-like), and its gameplay is not an attempt to realistically simulate combat, but because the game utilizes multiple classes, each with different abilities, Team Fortress 2 creates a diverse range of gameplay scenarios.  The acquisition of items is a rather entertaining little meta-game in itself.   Essentially, it is a shooter that can allow players on opposing teams to strategize and adapt their play as they see fit, with some players preferring Scout, Sniper, Medic, or Engineer roles (among others).  The diversity of player choices helps keep the game fresh, even long after you've played every map and scenario.

30,9250,9254,PlanetSide 2,"Having only put 20 hours into this game, I thoroughly enjoy Planetside 2. If you're into a more futuristic FPS, then this game is right up your alley. I love the big battles that you can get into sometimes. I also like the 3 different factions, although I feel the New Conglomerate is underpowered at times. I've only played as the New Conglomerate and the Vanu Sovereignty, but I enjoy playing as them (maybe the Vanu Sovereignty more :). The gameplay feels authentic sometimes. There's just a thrill that you get from the constant explosions all around and bullets whizzing past. The one problem that I have with this game is the grind. It takes a long time to get enough Certs to buy what you want, and then get them all back by grinding again just to get another item that you want. Planetside does have a membership that you can pay to get more XP and Certs, but you don't need to necessarily buy it unless you don't have enough time to grind. This game isn't pay to win,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Most of the items that cost currency that you can buy are just cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon skins, voice packs, etc. All in all, I do believe that Planetside 2 is a great game that everyone should give a try, and then put an hour or so into the game and see how you feel after that.

It resembles a potato on methamphetamine quite well. The objects and environment are of low quality and the textures are sub-par. The animations aren't horrible but they take to long to complete, for example i might go to shoot an enemy but they are already dead and i cant see this because the death animation takes to long to finish.The maps are terrible and arent very detailed, with few static environmental objects.

36,2706,2709,War Thunder,"Patch 1.37 ruined the game for me.  I thought that matchmaking was sketchy enough with the old system of 20 tiers of planes you unlock through nation EXP.  Now you have five tiers that you unlock various planes by using other planes or some such thing.  But what that means for me is that I have planes that were tier 6 previously being pitted against tier 10 and higher planes in the previous patches.  I am getting killed in basically one hit all the time, and it makes me never want to play the game again.update as of 12/20/2015:Game still broken, matchmaking is absurd, since the Ground Forces came out I was really excited for a ""realistic"" tank combat game, however, there needs to be a balance between ""realism"" and fun.  Right now you can expect to get shot right out the spawn and then (if you aren't killed immediately) you spend the better part of a minute waiting to repair whatever got damaged.

38,4856,4860,SMITE®,"At this point in time i have 799 hours logged. I'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other MOBA'S and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. Smite is a 3rd person MOBA unlike most MOBA's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of MOBA and the way i prefer to play a MOBA.I've only played around 3 matches of LoL, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other MOBA'sNow. to get to the basics, you have your Guardians,Mages,Warriors,Hunters and Assassins, All of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.Hunters- Hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy Tank.Mages- All around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.Guardians- Guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.Warriors- Warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.Assassins- Assassins are very crucial to your Conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being Overpowered, They're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.Now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.Pro's- Visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, Top down just isnt my cup of tea.Community- All in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other Moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other Moba's too me.Updates-Smite is regularly updated with new content Very Often, in the last year It's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, Gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but High-Rez stays on top of it.Gods-All of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and ANY of them can be good if they are in the right hands.Cons-Unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.Hunters- Hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play Neith,Ah Muzen Cab, Xblanque and many others, BUT they need to be nerfed unlike League (going by word of mouth) Yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, I'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, They make being a guardian not fun.Guardians- There are alot of fun guardians in the game BUT, as ive said in the previous statement Hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. Although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.Now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.I've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, I like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, Being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, You're not playing Ranked-Conquest. Stop acting like it, Thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of Dota 2, or LoL.Last thing is the server downtime, I want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, But, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in The last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. I've read many articles stating that it's Because of DDOS from other developers, I would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. My problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. So High-Rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, Please, try and fix this problem.Thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game Hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.I'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me.

66,7622,7626,Trove,"So, here's a review other than most of my other reviews. Not gonna make a list of what I did to try and get into the ""funny"" section, just gonna give an honest summary. I downloaded this game a few years ago and played it with my friend. It was very fun, other players were very friendly, and I got a toaster on a metal rod for a weapon (with toast inside the toaster, it actually did a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of damage for some reason). I don't know why, but I deleted it. Just a couple of weeks ago, I downloaded it again to see if I could relive some of those fun moments. It was horrible.

They made it to where you grind for everything but can use cash to speed it up. Seen these types of games before. As it stands its lacking alot of things and realy is a alpha as it stands not beta as they claim. 70% of the game is not finished  and most likely will  be locked behind a pay wall. AQ was something you just fiddled around with when theres nothing good to do and this as it stands is not worth it. They went 3d and turned out this turd that split the player base and most won't stick around.,0, early access reviewwell far cash grab seen played aq supported cash grab grind use cash speed seen types games stands lacking alot things realy alpha stands beta claim game finished likely locked pay wall aq fiddled s good stands worth went turned turd split player base wo stick

72,4520,4524,SMITE®," SMITE OverviewThis game is unlike any other MOBA games such as League of Legends and Dota 2. It has Third Person View, instead of the birds eye view you normally get with a typical MOBA game. The third person view is what initially made me want to try this game out.  I have put in over 300+ hours worth of gameplay and is one of  my favorite games i have played on PC so far.My friends believed that the game was just like another typical MOBA game but it is not! after my friends tried SMITE, we couldn't stop playing it.There are many different types of gods you can play as such as Guardian, Assassin, Warrior, Mage and Hunter. SMITE is Not a pay to win game, although you can buy additional in game currency [GEMS]. They are not needed unless you want to buy additional cosmetics that make your gods look better in certain aspects. Some times Hi-Rez releases events that are some times payed for with GEMS and some times which are free. the event enables you to either buy or work your way towards unlocking the specified unlockable, depending on the event.Hi-Rez continuously update SMITE which they bring out all new and exiting stuff such as Gods, Loading Frames, Voice Packs, BUG Fixes and Re-Works on characters. Hi-Rez also have just intoduced Recalling Skins. I haven't come across any exploites so far, hopefully it stays that way.I mainly play two game modes called Conquest and Joust. Conquest is a 5v5 game mode with 3 lanes a solo lane, a mid lane and a long lane and with jungles either sides. Joust is a 3v3 gamemode with one lane and one side of a jungle.There is a Competitive Ranked Play on SMITE but in order to access the ranked play, you must be level 30 and have mastered 18 gods for Conquest and 16 for Joust. the ranked play is much better than casual because its competitive. also you can also gain advantages by banning specified gods, in which you are unable to do so in casual. ProsThe Pros of SMITE are:+ Many gods to play as+ Competitive Play+ Great MOBA game+ Third Person View+ Continuously Updated+ Easy To Run+ Free To Play+ Not Pay To Win+ Many Events+ Cosmetic Items only+ Great Community+ Great Gameplay+ Great Graphics ConsThe Cons of SMITE are:- Sometimes get bad matchups in casual matchmaking- Not Easy To Level Up- Sometimes The Launcher Is A Bit Buggy ConclusionLastly i rate this game 10/10 and i recommend for people to try this game. The game overall is a brilliant game and i hope more people get involved with the game and to see more people enjoy it.

Contrary to popular belief, considering a lot of the reviews I read before trying the game, it's not that difficult. I didn't have to walk for hours to find prey, heck, I found prey within 5 min. of playing and continued to find prey with practical hunting techiniques. This isn't an instantly gratifying game like other First Person Shooters. This game, like real life hunting requires a little patience and an understanding that most wild animals have better senses than people do. Therefore, you can't just run down whatever it is you are looking for and engage in combat. You have to track, stalk, lure and wait for the correct moment to take your shot. I do agree though that the membership rates and in game currency are a bit expensive. I do recommend this game but only if you kind of know what you're getting into i.e. realistic-ish hunting and slightly expensive fees.

82,4519,4523,SMITE®,"I started playing this game on the 15th of August 2012, and little did I know that this game actually would be the most important game I've ever played in my life. It has given me so much. But storytime later, this is my review of the game. Every 2 weeks they give out a new patch, which shakens up the meta, balancing and adjusting gods, items and maybe changing some of the ingame elementals on the maps, and I believe every month there is a new god to learn to play and counter. It freshens up the game every time. There's 5 classes. Hunters, Guardians, Mages, Assassins and Warriors. Every class designed for a different role. ADC/Carry, Support, Mid, Jungle or Solo. However, it doesn't lock the classes to their designed roles. Usually you would want hunters for your carry and warriors for solo, but it doesn't say an assassin or guardian doesn't work for solo, or a mage for carry. It's all about your playstyle and how your team could work as a team and make the composition work. Every game is different for sure. There's alot of playmodes aswell. You have conquest, the standard ""Moba"" map with 3 lanes, a jungle and alot of objectives. This is the most competative playmode, and also the one where professional play is involved with. Smite esport is amazing to look at, especially if you enjoy playing the game and want to see some really good teams playing against each other with different practiced tactics. Then you have the ""casual"" gamemodes such as Arena, as the name states, you're basically just brawling out in a big circle with 3 different buffs on each side. Teamfights and kills are what this mode is for, but you have to watch the minions.Assault is also here, where everyone get assigned a random god, there's just 1 lane and you can't go back into base and buy items unless you die, which also puts your team in a disadvantage for some seconds until you return stronger to lane. However, being alive for too long puts YOU at a disadvantage. All random, all mid. This is also obviously the most unbalanced gamemode where your team can lose by just the gods you are assigned with. But hey, this is made for casual fun and playing gods you probably normally would, so why would you play assault if you're just going to complain? Then there's Clash. The ""Mix between arena and conquest"" which is 2 lanes, a huge buff-monster in the middle and some sidejungle with a mana buff. Quite fun, but also just really a cluster of switching between lanes and outplaying the other team. The last ""casual only"" gamemode is Siege, which also is two lanes, and has a big siege-monster in middle which is assigned to the team that gets the killing blow on it. This has alot of HP and brings down towers quickly. A quite fun gamemode where it's not 5v5 as most other gamemodes, but there's 4v4. There's also MOTD, or Match Of The Day to touch on, where balance is out and there is a new gamemode on rotation with different twists. Then you have the semi-competative gamemodes (with both Casual and Ranked involved) which is Joust and Duel. Duel is a ranked-only 1v1 gamemode where you ban out gods you don't want to play against, and it's only you to outplay the enemy. 1 lane with an objective to turn off the towers, and two buffs, mana and attack buff. It's all about outplaying.Joust is nearly the same, it's on the same map but it's 3v3. So you, alongside two allies plays against 3 others to see who comes out victorious. This game has so much to offer, tons of amazing skins, and a really great community, both on ""famous"" Smite players on Twitch, Twitter and aswell with Reddit and some groups on Facebook. Honestly, just all around the best MOBA out there to me, atleast, because it is indeed a 3rd person WASD-movement based MOBA.

92,5422,5426,World of Tanks Blitz,"I've Played somewhere around 2.000 battles in - ( May just call it the original WoT ) and I can't say I'm too disapointed with this one... The system requirements are really low and the casual way the battles play out seems pretty suitable for just ""a quick game"" maybe before school / work.  There could of course be more vehicles and maps in the game, but I would say it still makes a decent ""little brother"" of the original WoT.  Now despite what the hardware requirements say, the game ran pretty much flawlessly on a 1.80Ghz single core cpu, 3GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, getting 58-60 FPS almost the whole time using the highest preset and no AA.  And to people talking about some ""horrendous paywalls"".. you can actually claim a premium account for a couple of days for FREE. I currently have an IS (tier VII), a Matilda (IV) and an SU-85B (tier IV) and a couple of lower tier tanks that don't really matter and I've played 70 hours so far, where in the original WoT you would probably be still stuck at some tier 3-4 without a premium account. Also you don't lose credits by playing the heavy tanks as in WoT i actually wasn't able to pay for the repair + ammo resupply costs thus resulting in having to sell my IS and go back to low tier tanks just to be able to still play the game. Of course you could just pay some real money to get back into the game, but that sort of becomes a damn ""Pay2Play"", which is not suppossed to be happening in a free game.  Now you would be right saying that I was probably an avarege or even bellow averege player, but I had decent performance in every battle butI always gained around 2-10k credits for a win and lost around 20-30k for a battle that you lost - now mind that I wasn't using nothing but a gun rammer to reduce the loading time to I think somewhere decent.

96,14651,14656,Robocraft,"This game is terrible. I have over 270 hours of game time, so id know. Myself, and many others, loved this game before. However recent 'updates' made this game awful. Items started costing millions, you made 90% less, and mega bots were removed. But wait, theres more, now its a game of chance for what items you get, new players have no chance. You need to spend hundreds to even have a chance at some good items. Also. if your not premium, you get HALF as much. The grinding after lvl 100 is unheard of. This game used to be my favorite, then maximum loadout came, then 90% nerf, then my megabot i spent hundreds of hours of grinding dissapearing within a week of getting it. Also the devs hate everyone, they ONLY want money, not good gaming expierences. So dont bother recommending things to  them. If you dont have this awful excuse of a game, dont get it. If you have it and havent considered unistalling, i dont know how. So if you dont have a free 100 hours a week for video games, or are prepared to spend hundreds, its useless. Rant over. Going to play games that accually provide entertainmentUpdated review: Ive went back to the game for a round just to see what its like, here you go.

Every bot can have every weapon so theres no need for medics, snipers, tanks, or team play at all really.

97,15109,15114,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewTLDR; Check back in a month. Loot system doesn't reward. Game is ludicrously grindy.Played since release (pre-steam). Game was always grindy. But now it's worst than a Korean MMORPG. You get these crates, which contain from 1 to 4 items depending on the mode you played. If you're premium, you get twice an many items. Items now have a rarity, with the coolest being legendary, and the essentials being white/rare/epic.The concept is cool, but the items you get are essentially garbage. Let's say you have premium, and you open a Protonium crate you earned from acheveing top place in Battle Arena (which is like 30 minutes). A sample crate would be (after the ""fix"" patch), 7 green items and 1 blue item. Doesn't sound bad right? A♥♥♥♥♥♥hover, 20x triangle cubes, 20x window cubes (thats your rare), a single wheel, 20x corner cubes, a bottom left corner ""mask"" cosmetic, the flag of poland, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥rudder.As a new player, you can't make much out of that. You can upgrade your existing robot, but only to a certain point. As a played with an OK stock of basic items and a working robot (my situation), you can't do anything with that. And as a veterant player, it's all garbage.Problem is the distribution of items in the top tier crate, Protonium, is something like 10% white, 60% green, 20% rare/blue, 10% epic, 0% legendary.And amongst the item pool are ""cosmetic"" items. Masks, window blocks, flags.And you only get 1 item of each. Except cubes, you get 20 of those.So unless your idea of a robot is a handful of blocks with a wheel, a hover and a thruster, and a single gun, this game will make you work very hard to get a working ""set"" of items. Even more so if you want to upgrade from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tier.It's just not fun, the rewards aren't rewarding and they aren't coherent. There is this recycle/forge system, but right now you get 20% of the value of the item. So if you take all the items from that Protonium crate, you can melt them down and craft 1 or 2♥♥♥♥♥♥tier SMGs (you need like 9 to be effective). At 400 ""robits"" each. Let's say you want to craft that Flak cannon that guy blew you up with over and over in the last match. 75000 robits. That shotgun-like thing that other guy blew half you bot off in one hit with. 122500 robits. Thats a lot of crates. Like 300. 300 premium, top-place victories in Battle Arena, the longest match mode. If you lose you get the Bronze crate regardless of your performance.A positive point in all this, is that the crate tiers seem to not matter! So you can just practically idle, lose the game, and get your 8-item Bronze crate, and progress as fast as that other guy with his carefully crafted bot and hard earned victory that's getting Protonium crates.Check back in a month.",0, early access reviewtldr check month loot system reward game ludicrously grindy played release pre steam game grindy worst korean mmorpg crates contain items depending mode played premium twice items items rarity coolest legendary essentials white rare epic concept cool items essentially garbage let premium open protonium crate earned acheveing place battle arena like minutes sample crate fix patch green items blue item sound bad right hover triangle cubes window cubes s rare single wheel corner cubes left corner mask cosmetic flag poland rudder new player upgrade existing robot certain point played ok stock basic items working robot situation veterant player garbage problem distribution items tier crate protonium like white green rare blue epic legendary item pool cosmetic items masks window blocks flags item cubes idea robot handful blocks wheel hover thruster single gun game work hard working set items want upgrade tier fun rewards rewarding coherent recycle forge system right value item items protonium crate melt craft tier smgs need like effective robits let want craft flak cannon guy blew match robits shotgun like thing guy blew half bot hit robits s lot crates like premium place victories battle arena longest match mode lose bronze crate regardless performance positive point crate tiers matter practically idle lose game item bronze crate progress fast guy carefully crafted bot hard earned victory getting protonium crates check month

107,9612,9616,Realm of the Mad God,"I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's ""pay to win"". I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win. With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun.

116,12294,12298,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewI had my doubts about the game even before it started in the EU, so it's already flopped in Korea and Russia. And after a short time I realized that my doubts about the game were not unfounded. Problems that are said to have been fixed still exist. There are many minor bugs and a huge performance problem.Graphically the game is not bad, but in my opinion it can not keep up with TERA or BnS, although they are already older they run more performant. The frame rates collapsed completely in cities and even slightly larger groups of players are enough to reduce the game to under 30 FPS. Although I have a very high-performance system.Furthermore, the world and the characters in it seem very static.What bothers me most, however, is the "" reworked "" fighting system. It doesn't feel good, not liquid. It reminds a bit of BnS (at least in the Action Combat Mode), but plays itself extremely fiddly. Especially the new combo system disturbs me immensely. The keys to continue a combo are chosen very imprudently, or in principle the restriction to a given combo is rather hindering than something positive. The combos remind me a bit of TERA, but they can't keep up with the TERA system at all. Everything else in the combat system reminds me of BnS, but the combat system in BnS is also better in itself. In a nutshell, I would say that they tried to unite different fighting systems and created something bad out of it. I would like to say that the NA/EU release was only used to milk the cash cow again and then let the game die.",0, early access reviewi doubts game started eu flopped korea russia short time realized doubts game unfounded problems said fixed exist minor bugs huge performance problem graphically game bad opinion tera bns older run performant frame rates collapsed completely cities slightly larger groups players reduce game fps high performance system furthermore world characters static bothers reworked fighting system feel good liquid reminds bit bns action combat mode plays extremely fiddly especially new combo system disturbs immensely keys continue combo chosen imprudently principle restriction given combo hindering positive combos remind bit tera tera system combat system reminds bns combat system bns better nutshell tried unite different fighting systems created bad like na eu release milk cash cow let game die

128,7028,7032,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I'm gonna be honest, I never intended to try this. I'm not a huge fan of TES, but I do love the series and it's atmosphere. I was convinced this was simply another Heartstone ripoff, aimed to steal the audience. I imagined it as a cheap clone, because honestly, that's what it seemed like. I couldn't be more wrong. From games like MTG and Pokemon, where mechanics almost never change, to YGO, where a new one is introduced every other year (and it forces half the players to quit, because it gets worse and worse), to HS - the ultimate softcore TCG, I couldn't believe how TES: Legends achieved so much in inovation and freshness with just a few simple, but well placed mechanics. It really has to be tried to be understood.From the fact that it offers somewhat of a story mode, with actual content and choices, which reflect on your collection and individual cards, to the battlefield with two lanes, each offering different strategic options, via modifiers or simply via controlling the two lanes so you can manipulate your oponent into reacting in a manner that suits your intents, there is clearly a great amount of thought and design put into this TCG. And honestly, as someone who's always fallen for TCG games, this is one of the best I've played and the only one that actually takes advantage of being digital in way, that enchances gameplay - it's a feature that I've wanted to see in a digital TCG forever! In conclusion: if you are a TES or TCG fan, you deffinetely need to give this a spin. There is always a possibility of it not being up your alley, but beyond that (and certain meta/balance complaints that are always a given in TCGs), there is absolutely no reason for this game to be NOT recommended. It's an absolute gem.",1, gon na honest intended try huge fan tes love series atmosphere convinced simply heartstone ripoff aimed steal audience imagined cheap clone honestly like wrong games like mtg pokemon mechanics change ygo new introduced year forces half players quit gets worse worse hs ultimate softcore tcg believe tes legends achieved inovation freshness simple placed mechanics tried understood fact offers somewhat story mode actual content choices reflect collection individual cards battlefield lanes offering different strategic options modifiers simply controlling lanes manipulate oponent reacting manner suits intents clearly great thought design tcg honestly fallen tcg games best played actually takes advantage digital way enchances gameplay feature wanted digital tcg forever conclusion tes tcg fan deffinetely need spin possibility alley certain meta balance complaints given tcgs absolutely reason game recommended absolute gem
129,4879,4883,SMITE®,"Short review:  Smite is a good MOBA for anyone who wants to try one and for experienced players alike.Long review:  Smite is a MOBA that is somewhat different from others.  It has a third person perspective that I personally like.  There are a wide range of characters to choose from, 70 at the time of this review.  Along with the wide range of characters is 6 different game modes.There are 5 different character types to choose.  Assassians, which stick and move, securing a kill.  Warrior, who are constantly in the fight.  Hunters, long range specialists for ranged attack.  Mages, who deal a variety of magical attacks.  And lastly there are guardians, who play support but can also deal a lot of damage.The 6 different game modes differ quite a bit.  -There is arena, which is just a 5v5 deathmatch where your team tries to kill the other and escort minions into the enemies portal.  Reducing the enemies score to 0 wins this game.-Joust is a 3 on 3 mode that uses teamwork to advance to your enemies titan to destroy it to win.  Of course you must get through the enemy teams tower and phoenix.  This is a one lane mode with buffs for each team to pick up on either side,-Assault is 5v5 one lane fighting where you are randomly given a god and you and your team work your way to the enemies titan to destroy it.  Similar to joust, but you cannot go back and buy equipment or items until you are dead.-Seige is a 4v4 2 lane fight to destroy the opposing enemy titan.  This is more strategic than the other modes.  Teamwork is almost always nescessary here.-Conquest is the main game mode of Smite.  It is a 5v5 3 lane strategy game.  The goal is to destroy the enemy teams titan once again.  But teamwork and playing your role are a nescessity in this mode.  Conquest relies heavily on strategy.Overall Smite is a fun game for me, and I personally don't play many MOBAs.  There are a few minor issues I have.  Some gods play too similar.  The community can be toxic at times, and the servers can get overloaded at times as well.  But those are my biggest gripes.  I do recommend this game to anyone wanting to try a MOBA.",1, short review smite good moba wants try experienced players alike long review smite moba somewhat different person perspective personally like wide range characters choose time review wide range characters different game modes different character types choose assassians stick securing kill warrior constantly fight hunters long range specialists ranged attack mages deal variety magical attacks lastly guardians play support deal lot damage different game modes differ bit arena deathmatch team tries kill escort minions enemies portal reducing enemies score wins mode uses teamwork advance enemies titan destroy win course enemy teams tower phoenix lane mode buffs team pick lane fighting randomly given god team work way enemies titan destroy similar joust buy equipment items lane fight destroy opposing enemy titan strategic modes teamwork nescessary main game mode smite lane strategy game goal destroy enemy teams titan teamwork playing role nescessity mode conquest relies heavily strategy overall smite fun game personally play mobas minor issues gods play similar community toxic times servers overloaded times biggest gripes recommend game wanting try moba

145,5431,5435,World of Tanks Blitz,"I'm a WWII nerd so obvs I like this game, esp the WWII era of the tanks, you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc etc on the tanks, the way it was made, the reason why it was made etc, anyway personally blitz is much better vs World of Tanks (the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it). Blitz is a much faster pace, with less players on each side and a much smaller map. Along with that theres no ARTYS aka ""artillery"" which is blessed bc artillery is annoying. Playing this game over the years on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement, I guess thats the term idk, anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference. Whatever your better at controlling either holding a tablet or ipad, or just keyboard, personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while trying to shoot the enemy tank while trying to dodge, so you kinda panic ish but whatever. Just depends your play style. No big issues with the game, lots of updates frequently not very bad, from time to time there are events or speical missions pretty cool tbh. Currently most annoying thing has to be ""afk"" ppl, some I will say are afk others are not an afk issue, simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game, you load and don't load in until maybe 30 to 40 seconds after the game has started, pretty annoying. Second most annoying thing is when ppl say ""oh your a pay to win"" buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too....... even than whats worst is they run into open dies within the 1 min of when the game starts than blames on the team saying yall ""camping"". Personally I think once you start out playing this game, is kinda meh or boring etc, feels ""grindy"" bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc etc. Tier 8 in my opinon has the most action all type of skill level, you have players that are new if they bought a tier 8 premuim tank (not really pay to win, bc each and every tank has a advantage/disadvantage against any other tank, along with that it depends on how you play and how your team is). For example, some players with heavy tank (Powerful gun, strong armor, but slow speed), some players will literally sit in the back of the map -___- not saying you can't, but you really can't win the round if your gonna sit in the back and let your light tanks, medium tanks, or tank destroyer die, now not all are like that, some are very skilled, they're able to read on what they should do, shouldn't do against another tank, others *sigh* they yolo it as in push 4 tanks and die right in the open while shooting once and probably never hitting anyone or pen against them.Obvsly you start off with low tier tanks when you start the game, but theres a reason, to teach you oh how the game will be etc, you have many nations that you can pick (USA, USSR, FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINA, JAPAN, or BRITISH tanks) each one of those has there own special ""perk or skill"" For example German tanks, very heavy armor with strong armor, same with the soviet tanks, the french however are less armored, BUT they have a ""mag shell or autoloader"" as in they reload maybe 17-20 seconds depending what tank, but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shells in less than 5 seconds, as in lets say the AMX 50 100. You have 4 shells total in a mag, it takes 17? idk something around that seconds, but you can shoot 4 shells, you shoot once, than it takes 3.3 second to reload the next one and so on, until you shot all 4 than it reloads again with the full 17 seconds. Very overpower in its own way, if you have the timing, but can be annoying bad in times as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depends. Now the British tanks, very good, but they have one of the most if not most of all the tanks fires less than 7 to 9 seconds. Which as you get to higher tier it gets annoying and you'd want to take the british tanks out first simply bc their gonna keep nailing you before you can even reload the next shot. However some tanks like the Americans and Japanese tanks, you wont really see much of Japense tanks simply bc they kinda suck, however for American tanks you wont really see any tier 6 or 7 tanks, I hardly ever see any, simply bc every tank for any of the nation beats it. *COUGH COUGH* fix T20 bc its useless, but leads to the M48 Patton which is very good, not only that looks good too. Other than those tanks, you'll see a few tanks which don't look WWII era or ""stupid tanks"" However its nice to see different tanks instead of going against the same old tanks. Overall for customization, does not look bad, very different from the other World of Tanks, less things to add, but here the camos don't look as bad, they help you in the game, along with that I really look forward when they can create attachments for each tanks, like IS3, IS6 all the attachments looks sick, the American Eagle looks great on some of the American tanks, but position very odd. Kinda sucks that all Tier 10 tanks have their own Legendary Skin and attachment. If wargaming can make it so the customization is same for both platforms on blitz and the normal orginal one, it'd be blessed.Somethings to note about this game, there is rank, however not many ppl play it or atleast it takes awhile for me to get into a rank game. Theres 2 modes, team deathmatch and supremacy mode (capture the flag, theres 3 or 4 depending on the map first to 1k points or to knock out the other tanks win). Graphics aren't too bad, looks the same from my eyes on pc to mobile, sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max. Bit annoying at times when fps drops but whatever. Another thing, you won't be placed in a match in different regions, never had that happen, never really had bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi done you have good connection. Replay is nice, you can sometimes learn from mistakes on what you did etc etc, by rewatching the matches that you played. PS it is not a ""Pay to win game"" I haven't paid a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree, I only pay for the tanks that I really want aka lets say the scorpion, is a new tank that came out a couple of days, I had a dollar XD, was so stupid litterally just click and BAM got it with 1%, ppl get salty bc you get it and they couldn't but whatever. Anyway as I was saying only time you would pay is for getting more garage slots if you really want to keep every tank that you have gotten, PS you wouldn't really keep every tank, theres no point, just some tanks you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other, you instantly sell it XD. It just takes time to get enough xp for the next tank, not only that you need enough credits to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo, camo, gears etc many factors go in it. <---- also why people buy premium tanks is bc it gives good credits so that way you can ""grind"" faster. But you don't have to buy it you have a 1% chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crates every so day, week, so you have a chance.",1, wwii nerd obvs like game esp wwii era tanks learn history research etc etc tanks way reason etc personally blitz better vs world tanks normal tf wanna blitz faster pace players smaller map s artys aka artillery blessed bc artillery annoying playing game years pc mobile version big difference movement guess s term idk cross platform pc mobile version big difference better controlling holding tablet ipad keyboard personally keyboard bit annoying simply bc harder left hand away wasd trying shoot enemy tank trying dodge kinda panic ish depends play style big issues game lots updates frequently bad time time events speical missions pretty cool tbh currently annoying thing afk ppl afk afk issue simply bc maybe month start game load load maybe seconds game started pretty annoying second annoying thing ppl oh pay win buddy stfu honestly literally tank cost money s worst run open dies min game starts blames team saying y camping personally think start playing game kinda meh boring etc feels grindy bc need certain xp research new tier etc etc tier opinon action type skill level players new bought tier premuim tank pay win bc tank advantage disadvantage tank depends play team example players heavy tank powerful gun strong armor slow speed players literally sit map saying win round gon na sit let light tanks medium tanks tank destroyer die like skilled able read tank sigh yolo push tanks die right open shooting probably hitting pen obvsly start low tier tanks start game s reason teach oh game etc nations pick usa ussr french german china japan british tanks special perk skill example german tanks heavy armor strong armor soviet tanks french armored mag shell autoloader reload maybe seconds depending tank ability fast pace shoot total shells seconds lets amx shells total mag takes idk seconds shoot shells shoot takes second reload shot reloads seconds overpower way timing annoying bad times close combat v depends british tanks good tanks fires seconds higher tier gets annoying want british tanks simply bc gon na nailing reload shot tanks like americans japanese tanks wo nt japense tanks simply bc kinda suck american tanks wo nt tier tanks hardly simply bc tank nation beats cough cough fix bc useless leads patton good looks good tanks tanks look wwii era stupid tanks nice different tanks instead going old tanks overall customization look bad different world tanks things add camos look bad help game look forward create attachments tanks like attachments looks sick american eagle looks great american tanks position odd kinda sucks tier tanks legendary skin attachment wargaming customization platforms blitz normal orginal blessed somethings note game rank ppl play atleast takes awhile rank game s modes team deathmatch supremacy mode capture flag s depending map points knock tanks win graphics bad looks eyes pc mobile sadly pc version fps max bit annoying times fps drops thing wo placed match different regions happen bad ping play mobile wifi aka home idfk aslong play wifi good connection replay nice learn mistakes etc etc rewatching matches played ps pay win game paid single dollar tank tank tech tree pay tanks want aka lets scorpion new tank came couple days dollar xd stupid litterally click bam got ppl salty bc saying time pay getting garage slots want tank gotten ps tank s point tanks play hate xp instantly sell xd takes time xp tank need credits buy resupply ammo camo gears etc factors people buy premium tanks bc gives good credits way grind faster buy chance crate idk head free crates day week chance

147,3647,3650,Team Fortress 2,"Radically different from the going FPS standard.A gem gameplay wise.It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.That was the short version.If that didn't convince you yet, move along.The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being ""pay to win"" options - not in Team Fortress 2.Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic. This makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.Combat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.There's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.I guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking.There's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances.Eventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.Although 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.So, to recap:Whether you are casually or competitively motivated,whether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,whether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,whether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,you _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.And yeah.The only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.9.5/10, would will play again.",1, radically different going fps standard gem gameplay wise free excuse try short version convince mechanics playable classes based remarkably creative pretty unique class able perform mario style doublejump literally blow enemy missiles rightful owners faces soldier playstyle revolves surfing exploding rockets knockback graze available characters variety gameplay increased unlockable gear believe going fight foes pistol glass milk difference talking unlocks widespread disease free play games unlockable content pay win options team fortress items yor foe ensure advantage upsides balanced negative effects purely cosmetic makes game beginner friendly prevents new players straight outgunned additionally gameplay relevant stuff easily obtainable recieve free item minutes playtime allows advanced players customize characters visually gameplay wise better meet taste combat breaks away norm positive ways static health pool instead genre established regenerative system revolving mid ranged combat game shows complete lack assault rifles kind guess noticable difference games multiplayer fps genre confrontations players typically significantly longer fights designed recieving party nearly having chance react greatly appreciate personally feel titles like duty lacking negative things mention gameplay mechanics minor annoyances randomness damage modifier times wonky melee hit registration flaw shared literally multiplayer game minor annoyances eventually spoil overall expirience years old game steadily growing updated regularily bug fixes balance patches new maps items game modes released month ensuring wo end bored recap casually competitively motivated like proving skill players prefer fighting alongside hordes robots like stealth traps mobility based combat sniping want beat foes setting turrets slapping fish find enjoy game yeah thing costs time takes play

Money is also wasted on skills, skill pages, pets, mounts, and costumes that are way over priced practically $25 just for one costume. PvE is somewhat repetitive, my only focus was PvP for that reason. Now PvP I recommend you stay away from it, its not worth the time to waste to get good. This is how practically every match goes, outplay the opponent the whole match than opponent gets one catch gg its over. PvP is filled with people that are gear carried especially in the higher ranks. Of course one would say just to get geared yourself but than another issue arises which is connection. This games connection in pvp is quite horrible I live in the U.S. I would get matched up with people in Europe or South America. Servers are bad practically every match is lag heaven. I dont mind getting destoyed by gear carried people and if it were just that issue I would recommend this game but the lag in PvP killed it for me.  If your willing to deal with the issues this games has than by all means download it and waste your life on it like I did trying to get decent gear in order to not get destroyed in PvP by laggy gear carried people.

It is a completely different thing than what it was 10 years ago. Originally that was awesome, it was very unique and loaded with personality. But now it's a lost child, abandoned. In need of love and attention. It isn't as bankable as CSGO or Dota anymore, the updates have been awful, radio silence from the devs, it needs third party help and support BADLY. In order to keep it alive, Valve must give development to the community or another company. Smissmass 2018 was a horrible disappointment of an update, adding terrible hats and  doing nothing else.

In Trove you have 15 classes to play, so You have fun for a lot of time if You want to get them all on at least high level. The largest problem in this game, is I think, server working. Ping on server is sometimes horrible. Sometimes You can not even play, because at least enter the dungeon is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' impossible because of this. Once, I had over 1500ms for something about hour.But except of this problem, the game is awesome. Community is usually nice and they don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Your mother every night like in the other games. I recommend that game for all RPG type fans and of course other people because they also can have fun here.",1, game grinding experiencing things like like grind probably game played hours lot work want good game need spend time think play everyday hours like mmo rpg games graphics graphics kinda cool funny pleasing eye mainly square think need greatest computer world play optimal fps trove classes play fun lot time want high level largest problem game think server working ping server horrible play enter dungeon â impossible hour problem game awesome community usually nice â mother night like games recommend game rpg type fans course people fun

189,2024,2027,Path of Exile,"An excellent action RPG for all Diablo 2 fans out there. For me Diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. In Path of Exile I actually expect to find useful items. I constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.Another thing I disliked about Diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. Even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of ""Procurement"", you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.PoE has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. You could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but I disagree. You can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. The skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.The skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and I find it nicely flexible to fit whatever I want out of a build at the time. It's more than just unlocking a fireball; you can divide that fireball to several fireballs each dealing a bit less damage but that way gaining more AoE, you can then add other types of damage to it or even make it a damage-over-time focused fireball instead of explosions, if you so wish.In conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good ARPG experience. It starts out a bit slow but trust me, it's worth it and once you get into it, you won't be able to stop theorycrafting new builds to try.",1, excellent action rpg diablo fans diablo kind disappointment long story short loot feel exciting path exile actually expect find useful items constantly find getting excited rare item dropping basic white items crafting thing disliked diablo auction house ruined trading aspect completely removed interaction people maybe weird enjoy discussing prices people actually trading people setting semi automated shop use procurement interact people bartering poe microtransaction shop buy cosmetic effects armor skins effects weapons pets etc stash tabs argue stash tabs affect game way interpreted pay win disagree play game fine free tabs default pay inventory tetris bit choose items wish carefully skins buy armor weapons transferrable items characters buy apply effect item skill tree skill gem systems allow wide variety builds find nicely flexible fit want build time unlocking fireball divide fireball fireballs dealing bit damage way gaining aoe add types damage damage time focused fireball instead explosions wish conclusion wholeheartedly recommend game looking good arpg experience starts bit slow trust worth wo able stop theorycrafting new builds try
190,1467,1470,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewUpdate:  1 Year and 125 hours of gameplay later and this game has risen to my all time favorites list.  Matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base.  New and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so).  Visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before.  A lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad.  It's just heavily focused on grinding.  But the devs are active and listening, so I would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months.  I would like to also comment on a complaint I've heard a lot:  No, this game is NOT pay-to-win!  Lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that ONLY change aesthetics.  Now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved.  Challenge accepted!  Now go play Fractured Space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Original review below:Only had the chance to play one round so far but from what I can tell I'm really going to like this game.  There is definitely an initial learning curve, since I didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun I've ever had losing!  The ship textures are beautiful!  The weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome!  I'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it).  My only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes.  I have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, I'd see the network connection tank.  Would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going.  Died a couple times because of that.  (Not a problem with my network btw.  It handles all other online games including BF4 flawlessly).  I'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that I was just playing on a bad server).  All in all, this is a REALLY fun game.  The sort of game I've been looking for for a long time.  It's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars.  I'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it.

In no way shape or form will you just get that big buck or moose in the first few minutes of you joining a server. This game focuses on developing skills such as spotting and tracking and the more these skills are developed ingame the more proficient you become as a hunter just like you would IRL.(3) This game will appeal more to those who truely respect and/or love for the great outdoors. So therefore if you treat this game as a real life hunt you wont even notice you are actually playing a game.overall thoughts on this game:fantastic simulator that should be given a score of 10/10,1, typing review playing weeks devs game come long way yes bugs devs work butts fix fast review like pint yes need pay money actually able hunt majority species like point order hunt real life need buy license like real life hunting need time patient order drop big buck bull tracking way shape form big buck moose minutes joining server game focuses developing skills spotting tracking skills developed ingame proficient hunter like game appeal truely respect love great outdoors treat game real life hunt wo nt notice actually playing thoughts game fantastic simulator given score

If you die as a chicken or get polymorphed 3 times and you are eliminated.This is a simplified explaination, but there is a lot more I could ramble on about, but honestly you should just get in and give it a try.

There are some cool mechanics that I think can only really be done in electronic card games (or at the very least would be a pain to manage in paper games) and there isn't really any randomness unlike what I have experienced with other games.  Though you can purchase cards with real money, I have never felt the need to as the reward system is extremely generous (you earn a free pack for your first win daily, there are lots of ""objectives"" that will give you a pack or two upon completion, etc).  Lastly, it was quick to learn.  The introductory campaign covered a lot and there is a solid single-player ""puzzles"" section that allows you to understand the ins and outs of different mechanics.Overall, I highly recommend this game!

210,7424,7428,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"I play Hearthstone, I was looking for a more balanced, less RNG based card game, this fits that role.Except that it's the most bland thing I've ever played.The reason it's balanced is because every card is so boring, they are afraid to take any chances with their design. Most of the cards I see are stuff like 3/2 ""mudcrab"" or something like that, with no text, it's boring. I've come to appreciate Hearthstone after playing this game, it may not be as balanced, or skillful, but the flavour in that game is incredible. Most cards have beautiful colourful art with fun names, and cool effects, they are willing to take risks, which is how an online card game should be handled, since they can always nerf cards. In Hearthstone you'll get a card like ""Nightmare Amalgam"", a card that is part of every tribe, meaning it's a dragon, a demon, a mech, a pirate, etc and in Legends you'll get ""Whiterun Gaurd"" a 2/3 with gaurd. Even the legendary cards in Legends are super bland compared to Hearthstone. In Hearthstone a card with just stats and no text is pack filler, in Legends that's every card.Try this game if you have time, maybe I didn't play long enough to find the few fun cards they have, but I'm not willing to spend more time in this game.",0, play hearthstone looking balanced rng based card game fits role bland thing played reason balanced card boring afraid chances design cards stuff like mudcrab like text boring come appreciate hearthstone playing game balanced skillful flavour game incredible cards beautiful colourful art fun names cool effects willing risks online card game handled nerf cards hearthstone card like nightmare amalgam card tribe meaning dragon demon mech pirate etc legends whiterun gaurd gaurd legendary cards legends super bland compared hearthstone hearthstone card stats text pack filler legends card try game time maybe play long find fun cards willing spend time game

213,2521,2524,War Thunder,"This game can still be fun at times but doesn't really hold a candle to what it used to be.The devs are Russian and very obviously favor the Russian forces and have shown that update after update. Tank battles used to be more balanced and less 1 shot deaths but now it seems like anything under tier 5 can get 1 shot... from the front... 9/10 times. Plane battles can still be fun but mechanics are wonky and I can't seem to get the controls to work right on a gamepad (don't have a desk atm). I played this a ton on the ps4 and tried the pc version and lost interest. Its way more grindy than it used to be and can be PTW with crew upgrades and such. I wish I could upvote but I just can't.

218,11220,11224,Eternal Card Game,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt may say that I currently have less than 100 hours of playtime as of the posting of this review but rest assured that if it accumulates the hours I put in on mobile... well, let's get on with it.It seems to have some of the basic concepts of Magic: Attack phase occurs simultaneously for all attackers, summoning sickness(Only affect attackers and not tap abilities), you can assign blockers or let them hit you(Unlike some others where you can target whatever you like so long as it doesn't redirect your attack), fast spells(Instants) and 5 colours. That's where the similarities end.Pros:1. Multiple game modes, gauntlet to test your deck against AI opponents to grind gold or if you have unstable connection, forge, soft of draft-like mode against AI again, casual play, ranked play and even a unique drafting mode! Direwolf Digital is active in being creative with the game and there are multiple events held to keep one entertained. 2. Completely newbie-friendly, complete the campaign to learn the basics of the game and play to get deeper and learn multiple tactics. For card game veterans or people coming from MTG, you should feel right at home with this game.3. RNG. RNG is quite generous in this game, you have high chances of pulling a legendary from a pack or if you have cash to spare, buy a box to support the devs and get guaranteed legendaries! Of course, you'll get a guaranteed rare per pack which is quite good as you can dissolve duplicates for shiftstone to craft other cards.4. Randomness. Sure there are meta decks but the randomness is what makes it fun. Meme decks? Check. Home brew? Check. Whacky deck that people say will never make it in ranked but somehow boosts you up the ladder? Check. The sky and your creativity are the limit(That and shiftstone).5. Active fanbase and discord server. They're ready to help you whenever you want or need it. This also means tournaments you can take part in as you get familiarised with and good at Eternal.Cons:1. Randomness. This may be fun but not much when the rng is against you. Drawing a good hand or a good card when you need it is less likely than say, obtaining a legendary from cracking a single pack. Some draws are ridiculous and mulligans don't help much. You might get power-flooded or colour-screwed due to the game's drawing mechanism. However with the update of 2-4 sigils after mulligan, it helped, not much, but still helped a little.2. The timer reset. As with every game, there are bad sports, salty players or plain sore losers. The fact that the timer resets every time after they delay is a hassle. Problem is not really with the timer as people who run control decks may be forced to rush if so, but with these sort of players wasting time and ruining the experience. Not really a fault with the game or company, just the player base.Overall a pretty good and unique card game. May even be a solid contender for mtg with what it's doing right now if not for the loyal fanbase over for WOTC.

219,2897,2900,War Thunder,"Very fun game.. At first. The first few planes and tanks you play are quite fun. And then you start to unlock more planes and tanks and this is were the fun ends. You see there arent enough players to fill a battle in a timely manner so they squash tiers together to make things move along faster. In theory this may sound like a good idea. Until you get repeatedly 1 shot killed by the higher tier over and over again. And at the higher tiers there arent enough players to fill a battle so the highest ranked players go to the lower tiers and smash the new players with their fully upgraded planes and tanks with fully upgraded crews. Basically this means the newer players get frustrated and quit so there are no new players making it to the higher tiers. Its a vicious circle I guess. You cant get a game in a reasonable time at the higher tiers so they play lower tier games crushing and frustrating the new players so they dont make it to the higher tiers so there arent enough players to play in the higher tiers.

220,15616,15621,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewEh.. How do I put this.I know it's early access but If it's an MMO that has a pretty close release date I shouldn't be able to hit max level and get almost best gear in the game in the span of two days. Most armor seems to be cosmetic which is okay but one you have what you like there's very little reason to go further. You could spend thousands of gold on Royal Talon armor; if you really want stuff to do. Once you have Nightlocke weapons though you pretty much seen everything this game has to offer (Which I gotta tell you; isn't much).The cool things like Shadow Wolf Form and other Transformations; you know the things that might actually set this apart from the average MMO are unfortunately locked behind Kickstarter goals and pretty hefty ones at that. Movement is kind of janky still, combat is shallow despite the appeal of being able to change classes on the fly and almost multiclass. The UI is atrocious. Style is cute but the graphics themselves are very bright and almost painful to look at in some areas. Quests are beyond repetitive in the sense of you have to talk to the same npc 5 times in some cases, go and kill the same mobs at least 3 more times that the NPC wanted you to kill the first time around because they now need a different part of the monster (Seriously dude, I was just over there killing Flying eyes for Mana gizzards, now you want tears from them too? Why couldn't I have gotten that beforehand?!)Drickens are still cute, so it's got that going for it.

233,3932,3935,Team Fortress 2,"You'll think this game doesn't look appealing because of it's graphics and gameplay?Well i'd tell you this; you've got to give it a chance by playing it for like 5 hours, try out all the game modesand try out all the custom modes made by the community. After 4 years of playing this game is absolutely amazing. Not only because of it's high amount of comic and hilariousscenes, but also for it's original graphics, gamemodes, characters and much more.The 9 different characters in this game makes Team Fortress 2 so unique.For instance, it's tons of fun playing as the Spy character. This very unique character can go completely invisible against other online players. This one of the reasons I liked this game so much when I was 14. The ability to go invisible is one of Team Fortress 2's many appealing reasons to play it.By going invisible you can have tons of fun by playing around with it and using clever tactics with it. Are you bored after a few hours? No problem, you just switch to another character within a split second!Let's take the Soldier character, it's equipped with a huge rocket launcher on his shoulder which can obviously fire rockets. Something also very unique and great scripting is that you can 'rocketjump' with the rockets you fire. You shoot them at your feet, and you'll get launched away! This is just also very great and really amuzing!You'll spend hours and hours mastering those 'rocketjumps'. And is also a great reason to keep on playing Team Fortress 2.These were just 2 of Team Fortress 2's unique characters. These are all characters other First person shooter games don't have. This is one of the biggest reasons to try out this incredible game.Also something every First person shooter doesn't have, is that all the weapons are completely free! Reason why is that you 'find' them all eventually! You just play with your stock weapon at first until a screen pops up and says 'You have found a new weapon!' And poof, you've got one of TF2's 1000 weapons in your inventory, all shiny and ready to get played with. All weapons have their unique ability which can be great fun and tactical.Besides shooting rockets, grenades, blasting out fire and shooting a billion bullets a minute, there is also a whole different part of Team Fortress 2. And that's trading your items. Team Fortress 2 comes with a very unique trading system. You can trade your weapon you just found for something else via another online player. Beside weapons there are also a thousand hats for all your TF2 characters. So you can enjoy TF2 even more by dressing your characters either very fancy, scary, classy, funny or whatever you want!For anyone who wants a unique game, this is it.Free to play for everyone, so get it now i'd say!",1, think game look appealing graphics tell got chance playing like hours try game modesand try custom modes community years playing game absolutely amazing high comic hilariousscenes original graphics gamemodes characters different characters game makes team fortress unique instance tons fun playing spy character unique character completely invisible online players reasons liked game ability invisible team fortress appealing reasons play going invisible tons fun playing clever tactics bored hours problem switch character split soldier character equipped huge rocket launcher shoulder obviously fire rockets unique great scripting rocketjump rockets fire shoot feet launched away great spend hours hours mastering rocketjumps great reason playing team fortress team fortress unique characters characters person shooter games biggest reasons try incredible game person shooter weapons completely free reason find eventually play stock weapon screen pops says found new weapon poof got weapons inventory shiny ready played weapons unique ability great fun tactical shooting rockets grenades blasting fire shooting billion bullets minute different team fortress trading items team fortress comes unique trading system trade weapon found online player weapons thousand hats characters enjoy dressing characters fancy scary classy funny wants unique game free play

Nevertheless this is still amazing game, I used to play this a lot on browser, and I am glad they did turn it into a steam game, as I use steam a lot more than anything now.I love the fact that you have to actually play to earn your stuff in this game, because as the more matches you play, the more upgrades you can get for your monkeys which makes it more skill based, a lot of the time you have to make last minute decisions to make sure you can defend against both game and enemy bloons, which makes it very fun, I love that there are many different strategies and combinations of monkeys, that each person can have a different way to play.One of the only problems that I have with this game is that there is a surplus of cheaters, I was going for the achievement where you have to win 20 games in a row, I had gotten to 13 when I was met with someone who didn't take any damage, they let about 2-3 rounds worth of balloons though, and this really annoys me, I wish the developers would really try to work on this, as it makes me not want to play and in my opinion, is the biggest problem with BTD Battles.Either way, it is a great game, I love to play it when I have free time, so I do recommend this.",1, obviously bloons td battles ported browser game expecting different amazing game play lot browser glad turn steam game use steam lot love fact actually play earn stuff game matches play upgrades monkeys makes skill based lot time minute decisions sure defend game enemy bloons makes fun love different strategies combinations monkeys person different way play problems game surplus cheaters going achievement win games row gotten met damage let rounds worth balloons annoys wish developers try work makes want play opinion biggest problem btd battles way great game love play free time recommend

Do the devs not know how to put together a game...? Next, the client runs in the background. It launches when you start up your PC so I assume it installed some unwanted registry key that I didn't give any consent to. Finally, my desktop completely froze up when I switched windows to start up a recording. The cursor was locked in place so I couldn't do anything and alt-tabbing caused the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen forcing me to reboot.

254,1936,1939,Dota 2,"When I started playing Dota 2 I absolutely hated it. I refused to play it. No one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. During The International 3, I decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. Orange tearing through the Losers Bracket, taking out DK and pushing towards the finals. The commentators were going wild, I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but I knew it was epic. This brought me back to the game. We're now in the middle of The International 4 a n entire year later, I now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my Dotabuff.Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. When you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. You'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. But there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. These games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. The community isn't as bad as other MOBAs, but it's very easy to blame other people. If you win, people will sing your praises through the game. If you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself.  I've played a fair amount of MOBAs, from League of Legends and HoN to the more abstract Awesomenauts and Smashmuck Champions. Dota 2 has to be rated as the best. It's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. You can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. Go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. Games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics. The game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. Everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. This is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. There is a very steep learning curve. You also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. You will learn this with experience. I have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and I still don't know a lot of things about the game. I still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and I don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. It takes time and patience. Dota 2. It's a game I grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. The competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. And the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other MOBAs that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience. Easily recommended, but just be wary and try to keep your team mates relaxed and mediate them during those bad losses. You can't win every game.

255,10714,10718,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very fun card game. It's got complexity and variety. Compared to other online card games, I think this is probably the best I've played. Deck building is the most fun I've had in a while. Deck size and limits are sufficiently big to let you experiment, while most cards are balanced against each other, thus letting you build interesting and unique decks. The game has just had one expansion, and already there's a huge number of viable and competitive decks out there. The best thing about it is that the game doesn't encourage aggro decks (nor does it discourage it. It's perfectly viable to play any kin of deck.Cards don't depend so much on RNG, like they do in Hearthstone. What they do is clear from the beginning. As a result you don't feel you depend on luck as much as you depend on your wits. The only luck aspect of the game is what cards you draw (more on that later).There is no deck limit. You can have as many decks as you like. Guess what Blizzzard, no one is getting confused.Perhaps the most important feature of the game is that it's not Pay2Win. It's Play2Win. There's a lot of ways to gain gold, cards and packs that don't involve you paying for it every time. First of all, there's an exclusive game mode (Gauntlet), which you can play for free and as many times as you like. You battle against 7 AI opponents, and each victory grants you a reward chest. Depending on how well you went, you get an appropriate reward, and it's very easy to gather gold if you are willing to grind for it. It's not boring either, because the AI opponents are random and are actually competent at the game. Then aside from Gauntlet there are two other modes, where you need to pay gold (or real money) to enter: Draft and Forge. Forge works like Hearthstone's Arena, only you battle against AI opponents again. Draft works like MTG Draft games and here you get to fight against real humans. What's so great about these modes? Well aside from the final rewards you can get, YOU CAN KEEP ALL THE CARDS THAT YOU DRAFTED. That's right, you pay 2500 gold (Forge) or 5000 gold (Draft) and you get to pick cards according to your collection's needs. Buying packs is 1000 gold, and you get 10 cards per pack, which is well worth it. And then to top all this off, every single victory you make in Ranked or Casual play will reward you with some gold and a single card (at the very least, there's a good chance you can get a card pack out of it). I haven't payed a single dime so far, and I have a very respectable collection. I only started playing a couple weeks ago.The only real money you pay is for cosmetic stuff. And honestly, this game is so great and I appreciate the fact that it doesn't hound me to pay it money all the time, that I will indeed give it some. The devs have earned it.The game looks and sounds great. The card art is interesting, the animations and sound design are really nice and the overall atmosphere is just enticing you to keep playing.There are no bugs that I have noticed so far. Haven't had a single disconnect or server issue.Its only downsides for me are:- Constantly drawing mana cards can screw you over occasionally. There are no reshuffling mechanics in place. Decks require you to have 1 mana card in every 3 cards which can expound the problem. It's not such a big deal though because this is something that can happen in any card game using mana cards. The reverse can also happen occassionally. It's just luck of the draw.- Rumor has it that applications that help you keep track of your cards can get you banned. I can't confirm this, but if it's true, it's a bit of a headscratcher.- The ladder system needs a bit of a rework. The game can harshly penalize you for each loss, but you don't get an equivalent reward for each win. You can be winning more than 50% of your games and still not climbing the ladder.Overall though, these are minor things in the grand scheme of things. The game itself is amazingly enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone interested getting in a new card game.",1, early access reviewthis fun card game got complexity variety compared online card games think probably best played deck building fun deck size limits sufficiently big let experiment cards balanced letting build interesting unique decks game expansion huge number viable competitive decks best thing game encourage aggro decks discourage perfectly viable play kin deck cards depend rng like hearthstone clear beginning result feel depend luck depend wits luck aspect game cards draw deck limit decks like guess blizzzard getting confused important feature game lot ways gain gold cards packs involve paying time exclusive game mode gauntlet play free times like battle ai opponents victory grants reward chest depending went appropriate reward easy gather gold willing grind boring ai opponents random actually competent game aside gauntlet modes need pay gold real money enter draft forge forge works like hearthstone arena battle ai opponents draft works like mtg draft games fight real humans great modes aside final rewards cards drafted right pay gold forge gold draft pick cards according collection needs buying packs gold cards pack worth single victory ranked casual play reward gold single card good chance card pack payed single dime far respectable collection started playing couple weeks ago real money pay cosmetic stuff honestly game great appreciate fact hound pay money time devs earned game looks sounds great card art interesting animations sound design nice overall atmosphere enticing playing bugs noticed far single disconnect server issue downsides constantly drawing mana cards screw occasionally reshuffling mechanics place decks require mana card cards expound problem big deal happen card game mana cards reverse happen occassionally luck rumor applications help track cards banned confirm true bit ladder system needs bit rework game harshly penalize loss equivalent reward win winning games climbing ladder overall minor things grand scheme things game amazingly enjoyable highly recommend interested getting new card game

282,16256,16261,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Pros: Extremely detailed. Very relaxing. The actual process is exhaustively accurate (or at least aspires to be - I don't own a gun myself that I can cross-check their work with.) If a given part could not be removed in reality without removing another part, the game makes you do it in the correct order. It also forces you to deal with parts so small that they don't initially seem to be there even on a close examination. ""Plastic"" mode colors all the parts differently in bright neon colors to make them stand out more, useful in these cases. A competitive element that you can engage or ignore freely - each gun has leaderboards you can compare yourself against. There's also cars and skeletons to disassemble, although only a handful of each, and a motorcycle and two military vehicles. The game includes shooting ranges and challenges to allow you to play with the guns as well as just examine them, but it appears that not all guns have corresponding ranges. Out of the five I've unlocked, only two have such levels.Cons: You start with only three models - AK-47. 1911, and a human skeleton (under bonus models.) To unlock more guns, you have to either save up experience points or spend real-world money. If you're willing to spend money, you unlock guns quite quickly. To do it through XP, you have to grind. That's slow - I'm seven hours in, and have unlocked just three additional guns. (Keep in mind that each gun I have encountered so far takes no more than ten minutes to completely disassemble and re-assemble - and that's the first time attacking a relatively complex gun like the AK. The TEC-9, clocking in at less than forty parts, took just five minutes total, and judging by the leaderboards, I'm slow.) What's more, guns unlock in a specific order along a tree like a Civ V tech tree, except that it goes in multiple directions. You have to unlock eight guns to get to the Garand, for instance, and those eight guns take you in the opposite direction from the Desert Eagle, for another example. You cannot actually see the whole tree to begin with, either. You see the next guns available to unlock, and you can see vague outlines of the ones after that with no names or detail. After that, nothing. You have to consult charts made by other players to plan your unlocks more than two steps ahead. There's also a handful of guns that can be unlocked only with purchased credits. There are often  guns beyond these that can only be accessed by getting through that one gun - so while they're ""free,"" you can't get at them without having paid. Virtually all of the respectable handful of non-gun models are paid-credits only, as well.Conclusion: It's good for killing a few hours here or there, but completionists should be aware that it is impossible to 100 percent this title without paying, and everyone should be aware that what progress you can make is made only at a comparative crawl.",1, pros extremely detailed relaxing actual process exhaustively accurate aspires gun cross check work given removed reality removing game makes correct order forces deal parts small initially close examination plastic mode colors parts differently bright neon colors stand useful cases competitive element engage ignore freely gun leaderboards compare cars skeletons disassemble handful motorcycle military vehicles game includes shooting ranges challenges allow play guns examine appears guns corresponding ranges unlocked levels cons start models human skeleton bonus models unlock guns save experience points spend real world money willing spend money unlock guns quickly xp grind slow seven hours unlocked additional guns mind gun encountered far takes minutes completely disassemble assemble time attacking relatively complex gun like ak clocking parts took minutes total judging leaderboards slow guns unlock specific order tree like civ v tech tree goes multiple directions unlock guns garand instance guns opposite direction desert eagle example actually tree begin guns available unlock vague outlines ones names detail consult charts players plan unlocks steps ahead handful guns unlocked purchased credits guns accessed getting gun free having paid virtually respectable handful non gun models paid credits conclusion good killing hours completionists aware impossible percent title paying aware progress comparative crawl
283,3466,3469,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewThis is an early access game that in my opinion is in a very good state, here are some bugs but that's understandable.Notice that this is not a traditional Battle Royal game: there are up to 4 winners in this game. Also it happens in a snowy environment and has three player classes which makes a nice combination of features in the game. Recently the developers added a season pass ($10) which, as usual in this kind of games, provides cosmetic changes.There's FortNite (which is more comics like), there Player Unknown battleGrounds (which is more realistic, plus was the pioneer), there was Islands of Nyne (which died because of being a complex game plus competition against the 80 tons FortNite mamooth), and there's Ring of Elysyum which .... in my opinion is a very nice game, well built.Also, developers are really paying attention to their officel reddit forums.

288,9055,9059,PlanetSide 2,"EDIT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am editing my review as I have put another 110+ hours into the game since the original review was posted. I think I can explain the game additionally now seeing every side of the game.Over those 110 hours I realized the game doesn't change mainly because of the community.The community, what's left from it is all veteran players that have been used to the system for so long. No changes will be made to the game as its community is slowly but surely dying. On peek times around 4000 players a day, not a good sign, to top that SOE just announced merging of 2 US servers because of low population.As a new player: the game is extremely harsh for new players, not only are you put in a significant disadvantage from the start with crappy weapons, you are thrown into the game without a single idea of where, who or what you are doing or suppose to be doing, against all max ranked players that dedicated their lives to farming you.On top of that, anyone trying to get into the Vehicleside 2 side of gameplay is pretty much sure to fail. As all players are on the same map at the same time, your stock vehicle will get melted in nanoseconds, your only choice is to get stomped for probably hundreds of hours until you get it good enough so you can stomp infantry and vehicles alike.Oh but wait! You can always put your credit card out so you can buy better infantry weapons, only 7 bucks each! And they don't transfer over your other characters..This section will be for the thoughts of the community, I have spent a lot of time trying to get into the mind of these vet players and even though this is not the thought of EVERY player, it is of the majority.General thoughts of vets: Infantry is scum, almost being NPCs in a true MMORPG. those NPCs are for farming certs (currency which is used for buying all weapons and upgrades), the only true skill in their mind are massive vehicle battles, (one hand on the mouse, point and click and the other is for you can only guess what), the order is like this, infantry is the worst (almost everyone agrees on that) < tanks < aircrafts. Whole game could be compared to an MMO where your character is in a vehicle and farms infantry - NPCs. Good thing this game is an FPS MMO, because that's a complete lie. Being a foot soldier in this game is considered primitive and everyone who enjoys the FPS aspect is an ape in the eyes of the community, naturally SOE gives in to their requests and with every patch either messes up that fragile ""balance"" or completely throws stuff out the window. For them it is completely fine for infantry to get one shot by almost every vehicle weapon, but vehicles are almost godlike, in firepower and survivability. Only thing in question is which vehicle will be the most powerful one.Anyone trying to even suggest a change on the forums is only met with responses similar to ""go play cod kid"".Only thing I got wrong in my original review is the rebalancing part. The whole game requires complete revamp of major game mechanics and design choices, something that will never happen.Don't even try this game, I can't recommend it simply as the community is dying and what's left of it is under illusion Vehicleside 2 is how it's suppose to be. My old review is still correct and gives good examples of the ""balance"" in this game, luckily I can put this game to rest once and for all on my part.Original review ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello everyone,When I first saw this game I was looking for a casual FPS that could satisfy my need for killing. Sure enough, this game did the job, hundreds of people on the same map, maybe even thousands, who knows.The game cannot be compared to Battlefield or Call of Duty, features unique playing styles with a lot of diversity in weapons and classes.Good sides, massive online fighting pretty much all day long, 3 major maps on which you fight, each one with around 40 other sub maps for you to capture or defend, open world shoot out, terrain limitation is almost none, you can create your own pathing for the best position and ambushes. Great weapon arsenal, a ton of guns from SMG's, assault rifles, snipers, you name it. The guns mostly perform differently and look differently, 3 factions for you play with and they are all unique.Crazy battle moments with vehicles like tanks, light vehicles, air units, the whole idea is to feel a part of something greater than a common soldier and this game nailed it, the feeling when you fight 100 vs 100 is epic, even though you might be playing alone. Probably best of all, you get all these good things free.Sadly, like every game, this one has downsides, flaws that destroyed the game for me.The game with all of the air and ground units has serious balancing issues. Massive battles mostly turn into a camp fest when one side brings in around 20-30 tanks to one base. Camping the spawn point of the other side, pretty much destroying not only their defence but the whole experience of the game.Infantry is unbalanced as well, out of the daily best players, all play heavy assault or light troops, pretty much 2 classes are chosen all the time because of the weapons and their survivability, not very interesting for the other ""weaker classes"".Others have decent utility but when it comes down to who can tank more shots, which you might think is important in a 100 vs 100 game...those 2 are pretty much the only choice. Air offensive is just as bad, like tanks, they pretty much have unlimited ammo, spamming the whole artilery on just one guy that actually made it 10 meters from the spawn. All vehicles beside one or two are very hard to destroy, taking around 7-8 anti-tank missiles, after which they simply hide behind a rock or something to be repaired within 5-10 seconds and the process repeats itself, considering 1 player only needs to press deploy on a console and instantly has a tank or aircraft to drive, not a fun experience at all.What to say about balance when an aircraft, ""Liberator"" dives in, sits, yes, lands on 2 tanks and destroys them instantly without taking almost any damage, also most vehicles don't take damage from anything than rockets or flak cannons, found on other vehicles mostly...Game also has some bugs that makes some players invincible, hackers, almost none, I don't really know, might be a few, but it's a free to play so I don't mind. Also the game randomly crashes several times a day, even has errors with Nvidia graphic cards that makes the card turn off for some time in the game only, causing you to lose the screen for some time.The game in general is good for anyone who just wants to shoot something every now and then.  It has problems like every other game does, but these I can't just ignore. It has potential but requires balancing.",0, edit editing review hours game original review posted think explain game additionally seeing game hours realized game change mainly community community left veteran players system long changes game community slowly surely dying peek times players day good sign soe announced merging servers low population new player game extremely harsh new players significant disadvantage start crappy weapons thrown game single idea suppose max ranked players dedicated lives farming trying vehicleside gameplay pretty sure fail players map time stock vehicle melted nanoseconds choice stomped probably hundreds hours good stomp infantry vehicles alike oh wait credit card buy better infantry weapons bucks transfer characters section thoughts community spent lot time trying mind vet players thought player majority general thoughts vets infantry scum npcs true mmorpg npcs farming certs currency buying weapons upgrades true skill mind massive vehicle battles hand mouse point click guess order like infantry worst agrees tanks aircrafts game compared mmo character vehicle farms infantry npcs good thing game fps mmo complete lie foot soldier game considered primitive enjoys fps aspect ape eyes community naturally soe gives requests patch messes fragile balance completely throws stuff window completely fine infantry shot vehicle weapon vehicles godlike firepower survivability thing question vehicle powerful trying suggest change forums met responses similar play cod thing got wrong original review rebalancing game requires complete revamp major game mechanics design choices happen try game recommend simply community dying left illusion vehicleside suppose old review correct gives good examples balance game luckily game rest original review saw game looking casual fps satisfy need killing sure game job hundreds people map maybe thousands knows game compared battlefield duty features unique playing styles lot diversity weapons classes good sides massive online fighting pretty day long major maps fight sub maps capture defend open world shoot terrain limitation create pathing best position ambushes great weapon arsenal ton guns smg assault rifles snipers guns perform differently look differently factions play unique crazy battle moments vehicles like tanks light vehicles air units idea feel greater common soldier game nailed feeling fight vs epic playing probably best good things free sadly like game downsides flaws destroyed game game air ground units balancing issues massive battles turn camp fest brings tanks base camping spawn point pretty destroying defence experience game infantry unbalanced daily best players play heavy assault light troops pretty classes chosen time weapons survivability interesting weaker decent utility comes tank shots think important vs game pretty choice air offensive bad like tanks pretty unlimited ammo spamming artilery guy actually meters spawn vehicles hard destroy taking anti tank missiles simply hide rock repaired seconds process repeats considering player needs press deploy console instantly tank aircraft drive fun experience balance aircraft liberator dives sits yes lands tanks destroys instantly taking damage vehicles damage rockets flak cannons found vehicles game bugs makes players invincible hackers know free play mind game randomly crashes times day errors nvidia graphic cards makes card turn time game causing lose screen time game general good wants shoot problems like game ignore potential requires balancing

Years of anticipation, and the best artix entertainment can offer us is a crappy mobage which just happens to be playable on PC.- Sound is sorely lacking. There are no noises for navigation through menues, the launcher is entirely silent, and bland, 20-second soundtracks play once when entering into areas (not the tutorial level though, which is about as silent as the forementioned launcher)- Crappy fullscreen functionality; image is always rescaled. Interior resolution of in-game resources seem to be inconsistent, and I haven't been able to get a non-stretched loading screen- Utilises a premium currency system, as the rest of their games have (I'm impressed they had the tenacity to come up with this kind of stuff since before the release of the iphone). Minimum expenditure of $5, with crappy starter items right out of the first real area of the game being sold at a value of around two of those five dollars- Gameplay is absolutely shallow. Victory is only determined by your level, and how many of those 50-cent potions you happen to have on hand- Camera is hard to manipulate.

But after these series of terrible updates, Robocraft has become a mess of poorly thought out ideas, over powered weapons, and mindless rage endusing gameplay.

Prefered would be a ""Medium Update every 2-3 months"" to keep matters fresh.NEGATIVE- The game isnt exactly the most polished. Bugs are found in several corners, and while most of them arent gameplay impacting to the level that youll find yourself blaming a bug for a death, its just ugly.- 10 Years of Updates on the Source Engine can do a number on ya, making the game somewhat unstable and unoptimized.- The Death of Community Servers.==================================================================This game is something special alright, not only was it with me for 7~ years now, but it's also something life changing.

Team Fortress 2 is responsible for some of the most fun I had in a videogame and it will probably stay like for that several years to come. And here comes the Tragedy. Community Servers have been what made TF2 extremely fun to me; playing with friends, people you know, on a famillar enviorment. Now that's gone, because the TF Team wanted to make the game more consistent and streamlined for newcomers. People will never get to experience a Community Server ever again unless its some weird memeshit like Saxton Hale, and that's awful.I still enjoy the game, I still play it with the friends I made on Community Servers - But I just question, players that didnt experience said community servers, where will they make their friends?

317,13797,13801,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewInitially, I wrote it off as another cheap Minecraft knockoff. Truth be told, though, the trailers are badly outdated; the game is much more polished than is hinted at. A friend of mine picked it up and started playing it, and pestered me to join in. Since it was free, I decided to go ahead, why not. And I'm glad I did.I've seen several people saying that this game does Minecraft, but better, and in some ways I agree with that. The development is also very active, responding well to input from the community for suggestions and noting bugs that need to be fixed. They even throw in some nice holiday specials as an added bonus. This won't completely replace Minecraft for me, but it is a nice fresh take on the crafting-survival genre, and it does it well. When I have the time, I will likely purchase the Pro pack to give my support to the developers for a job well done. As my hours spent in the game will tell, I am hooked.Pros: Active development and bug fixes, interactive devs, holiday specials, smooth and engaging gameplay, variety of building blueprints for the lazy/challenged builder, Pro upgrade not a pay-to-win but not empty bonuses (good balance)Cons: Still a few bugs being worked out (items getting stuck in inventory, AI pathing rarely glitching, mostly minor things that can be solved with relogging and are also being worked on actively), combat a difficult pain at first (circle-strafe your target and/or use stun bombs, upgrade armor until easy to face-tank damage), no server modifiers (ie difficulty and spawn options) unless Pro member.Overall, most of the cons are nitpicks and most will be phased out over time as development continues, or even as your progress in gameplay moves on. The pros make the game for me. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try, and don't get discouraged if the mobs seem too difficult at first.

324,15785,15790,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewOnly thing I don't have a problem is the content overall... They did do a good job over the years with a majority of the content.But let's be very honest here. We got players on this game who are pretty stupid and by that... Lets say like majority have an IQ of 5. They don't have anything better to do than just sit around and bash n troll each over over stupid game currency or W/E. They also lie about a lot of what they do In-Real-Life just to make themselves imitating. and this applies on AQW as well. Community is legit cancer. So that's one very major downside.Next, Some developers make way too many reworks. Devalues the original rares the real veterans spent time to obtain all those years. Maybe be more creative instead of copying stuff yeah? And maybe also not seeing certain players as special because I cannot recall how many AE players on Twitter beg the developers for random special rares because they thought they were special. They need to do this for all ex and current moderator and testers because they end up getting an unfair advantage by loading rares that won't be removed from their accounts. So the rework and loaders is another very major setback.Now I'm speaking for everyone on this one. Biggest one none of the staff members were able to EVER address... Bots. Way too many of them. Yes they were originally on AQW but now I've seen a few of them on AQ3D now. I personally spoke with the lead moderator for AQ3D regarding this once. Nothing has been done about that. And same story for AQW. Nothing's been done after sending a email in concern. There are far more bots on AQW than AQ3D. But without anyone dealing with the botters on both games gives the cheaters a bigger and of course... An unfair advantage.Now, these are 3 major reasons why I DO NOT recommend this game nor would I recommend the other version. This is also why it has gone downhill ever since 2012. If the AE staff were to assess and do something about these key points, there is a chance I'd see hope for AE again. It's also why I don't come on both games that often these days.~Lucario-Original AQ Player since June 2005.-AQW Player since Beta Testing in June 2008.-AQ3D Player since Alpha Testing in August 2015.

332,1373,1376,Fractured Space,"Update as of November 2018:The game development has been stopped and since the release of the final update the playerbase has diminished from small to almost no-one playing. Therefore anyone who is looking for a new game to play should avoid Fractured Space.I will leave the recommended tag on this review because I had a lot of fun with this game while it was still active.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The purpose of this review is to go over the free to play model that the game Fractured Space uses. As for the game itself, Fractured Space is a well balanced team based multiplayer game with the main attraction being the variety of large space ships that you can pilot.Fractured Space uses a free to play model which lets you play the game starting with access only to a few starter ships. To unlock more ships, you need to earn in game credits or pay money for a special currency called platinum. Credits can be earned upon completing matches and from completing missions. On average, completing a match will get you ~10,000 credits or more. Missions are side objectives listed in the hangar such as ""get 24 takedowns"" or ""capture 15 mines"". Completing missions will typically get you a drop pod, which can contain extra credits, platinum, and other useful items.Ship costs vary from about a half million credits to about one and a half million credits. If you want to unlock ships without paing for anthing, you will need to play quite a few matches. Since the average match time is about 30 minutes, that translates into a lot of playtime.Personally I would recommend buying the ""Fleet Pack"". It is normally priced at 50.00 USD, and usually go on sale for 25.00 during major Steam sales. The Fleet Pack gives you access to a staggering 34 different ships to try out. This means you can spend more time playing as ships with playstyles you like instead of feeling like you got stuck with something terrible that you need to use for another 40 matches before you can test out another ship. And while you try out new ships, you will be able to spend your credits on different weapon types and crew members to personalize your ships.There is only one thing that I have seen in Fractured Space that you cannot get by using credits: ship skins. Otherwise, you can use credits to purchase what you want.Fractured Space is not pay to win.

I started playing that game in 2012-2013 and I never played tanks until recently and it took a while to get used to / into it (coming from planes) but now it feels much better and more natural than this game.

335,2273,2276,Path of Exile,"After playing the Diablo Series, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, and both Torchligh games, my friends suggested I play Path of Exile (aka PoE). So i did got 2 characters up to 24th level (this was before the 4th chapter exsisted) and just lost interest in it. However a few months ago I wanted to play a ARPG again, being bored of Diablo 3's grindy story retread end game I picked PoE back up on a whim. This time it hit the right spot, and I bull dozed through all 4 chapters on each difficulty and have done 2 of the 4 Lab runs. Now i just adore this game, from its Materia-like (Final Fantasy 7 refrence) ability system to its passive skill tree (like a much more refrined Final Fantasy 10) and now have a Necromancer (Ascendant Witch) up to level 71 (level cap is 100 i believe) and cant wait to make my next character. Now the end game of PoE is a bit grindy too (but also very challenging) doing maps and stuff, but its the level of customization, the trial an error of skills and abilities that makes it worth it. Also to not there are 6 NEW chapters coming soon with the free ""Fall of Oraith"" expanson so making the main game 1 play through instead of 4 chapters on 3 different difficulties. I for one cannot wait, and would recomend this to any ARPG fan.Solid 8 out of 10And just for compare to other ARPGsDiablo 3 = 6.5/10Titan Quest = 6.25/10Grim Dawn = 7/10Both Torchlights 6.5/10",1, playing diablo series titan quest grim dawn torchligh games friends suggested play path exile aka poe got characters level chapter exsisted lost interest months ago wanted play arpg bored diablo grindy story retread end game picked poe whim time hit right spot bull dozed chapters difficulty lab runs adore game materia like final fantasy refrence ability system passive skill tree like refrined final fantasy necromancer ascendant witch level level cap believe nt wait character end game poe bit grindy challenging maps stuff level customization trial error skills abilities makes worth new chapters coming soon free fall oraith expanson making main game play instead chapters different difficulties wait recomend arpg fan solid compare arpgsdiablo quest dawn torchlights

366,15762,15767,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewTrying to recommend this game is trying to tell me that I should kill my Palico on Monster Hunter World: It's impossible.Many of Artix Entertainment's adventures into Lore have been interesting, from the ever-nostalgic AdventureQuest, to the dragon-infested DragonFable, to a Lore where every kid who can't PvP uses Void Highlord on AdventureQuest Worlds. Now we have the most linear and most boring of these Lore adaptations, not to mention the most toxic of communities.I started playing, got the name Chronicle, got the Chronomancer set, and I was happy not spending any money on the game. Reached the graveyard where everyone else was struggling, and regardless of the many people that are in the area, nobody was interested in helping each other. I do admire, to a full extent, of AE's intention to pull away from the ease of doing everything yourself, to relying constantly on teamwork to push through. While this would normally work, it doesn't when everyone you meet is a constant jerk. Even some of the most recognisable faces in AQ3D would rather brag about what items they have over helping the newer players who haven't a clue. It's become so biased and it's hasn't had a long full release yet.Let's not mention a lie that has doomed the game from the very start. It had been started that ""as we have always said, micro-currency will never pay-to-win power but will be used to (among other things) save time"", which was intended for the crafting system, but the rest of the game is reliant on being as rich as a guy with a Burning Flames Team Captain on TF2 just to catch up from level 1 without missing out. The kickstarter rewards, not to mention, are nonsensical. Instead of physical items that can be souvenirs from a time where you provided monetary assistance to get the game out, you're instead treated to virtual items that may/may not provide a headstart to a game that was meant to be free of the P2W stigma. Instead, they've since welcomed it. It's the typical Steam MMO we hoped it wouldn't be.It's such a shame. As Artix von Krieger's friend and fan, I'm utterly disappointed with how AQ3D turned out.

374,11219,11223,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewWhelp, what started as a hopeful replacement for the terrible current meta in hearthstone, i have put enough hours into this game's ranked play to conclude it's even more poorly balanced than yugioh, and even very low ranks are infiltrated with decks and players far in excess of what their ""rank"" belies. I'm strongly familiar with MTG as i have decades of experience playing it and am no slouch with strategy, timing, counterplay, bluffing, etc. While i credit this game for having the kind of depth that hearthstone lacks, it is a shame that the game is otherwise wrecked by awful balancing and match making. There are some absurdly powerful decks and combinations, and wouldn't you know it, 5/6 players you meet are playing cookie cutter top meta builds. This is identical in nature to hearthstone where players with 52+% win rate decks intentionally concede their way to lower ranks for the purposes of easier grinding of in game currency and quest completions off potentially lesser skilled players YET should they be interested in players of comporable decks and skill they need not procede up the ranks, as everyone is right there with them at the bottom. This game continues to suffer from the usual issues you can expect from a MTG knock-off (mana-flood/drought) happening way more often than one would think possible, and utterly avoidable considering the digital formating, the games quickly devolve into whom can be first to inact their imbalanced strategy or who is last to fail to achieve the power resources they need. This game's design philosophy seems mired in a swamp of developer ideas of ""what would happen if we made late game strategies possible by turn 2?' Genius. Also, Pay2win in the extreme.

375,14630,14635,Robocraft,"Fun game. ruined by P2W, and terrilbly balanced games. its rare that you get a balanced gameAfter a bit of thinking about it wouldnt really be P2W, but I feel like the pay to play aspects of it are still destorying this game. Before you actually had the option to pick out exactly what you wanted from the store which you would unlock with ingame money you earned. I will admit this was a grind but it could be done. i reached teir 9 without investing a thing into this game. and premium would get you double points for reaserching items and buying stuff. Now insteed of seeing and buynig what you actualy want to finish up your robot you're insteed thrown tons of items that you dont want at all. Lets say you try to recycle those to get the items you actully want, well you better get ready for even more grinding because you only get 1/3 of the weapons worth through recycling (unless you're premium) and even then you only get half of the items that you would if you were premium (and in my expreance all the rarest items are stuck in the premium row to really manipulate you into paying for premium) then the icing on the cake is that you are able to buy loot crates. I received 25 of these crates for free from being early access, and I received enough robobits to buy 1 legendary and received 1 epic. (25 crates costs 10$ incase anyone didnt know)To me this is far worse than P2W, because insteed of trying to get you to simply buy the best gear that you can and get it over and done with. You have to buy 100's of crates and still have to hope you get all the items you actully want.If theres any of you who even got to this point and are still thinking that its not pay to play or that what they're doing is fine I would ask you to look up what whales are for freemuim games. because thats exactly who this game is targeting to sell to.",0, fun game ruined terrilbly balanced games rare balanced gameafter bit thinking nt feel like pay play aspects destorying game actually option pick exactly wanted store unlock ingame money earned admit grind reached teir investing thing game premium double points reaserching items buying stuff insteed seeing buynig actualy want finish robot insteed thrown tons items nt want lets try recycle items actully want better ready grinding weapons worth recycling premium half items premium expreance rarest items stuck premium row manipulate paying premium icing cake able buy loot crates received crates free early access received robobits buy legendary received epic crates costs incase nt far worse insteed trying simply buy best gear buy crates hope items actully want s got point thinking pay play fine ask look whales freemuim games s exactly game targeting sell

The P2W elements are not very expensive (I've seen worse). Today I played a PVP duel. I got my opponent into 400LP left. Then he played a monster with an effect that makes him pay 1000LP at the end phase. So I was like ""YES! He's gonna suicide at the end of my turn, I won!"".

381,14896,14901,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewWell, I'm sorry to say that the developers have managed to wreck what was one of my favorite games. 1. The new battle mode is lame. I am not interested in blasting cubes off of towers. I want to engage enemy bots. Yes, I know that is still ""part"" of the game, but is should be the only part. I think it would work much better to simply have zone control based on sole occupation of areas (similar to world of tanks). Also having too many modes has caused crazy long que times. What used to take 5 - 20 seconds to join a match, now can take 15 minutes.2. The developers have decided that components that are higher tier should not be placed on lower tier bots. This has essentially ruined all my bot designs and makes the game (bot design and game play) very cookie cutter. It doesn't balance game play as much as it creates identical builds due to fewer options.I will NOT be back to ROBOCRAFT. Way to turn victory into FAIL.

392,10056,10060,theHunter Classic,"(I have played this game since around 2011 when it was a single player game and even before it came to Steam, in total I have a few hundred hours played)THERE IS A TUTORIAL. If you can't find it yet still somehow start a hunt, don't play it. You clearly don't have the chops for this game, sorry.Let me open this up by saying if you're under 16 or have some kind of attention deficit disorder, stay away. If you're the kind of person whom while playing MMOs jumps on your mount to run 10 meters and tries to hit max level on the first day\week, stay away. If you're the kind of person who thinks games like the ArmA franchise are 'boring' stay away. If you're the kind of person who thinks 'Free to Play' should mean: ""Give me everythig in a week so I can move on to the next game like a ravenous locust"" stay away. If you can't take the time to read a few pages of text, stay away.This game requires an insane amount of patience, forethought and time. It requires you to learn animal behaviours, how to use lures. It'll teach you how to stalk, stay down-wind and it'll teach you to ease off the trigger and wait for that pefect shot. But it won't beat it into you. If you don't learn, you'll never kill anything, and you'll blame the game for your own hysterical ineptitude.The game is your typical huting style game, you enter a range with a few buddies, gear up and go looking for game. If you're an idiot and run around everywhere, you'll hear nothing and see less. See my point above: Go low, go slow. Follow the trails the animal has left. Spot it's calls and get yourself in range for a quick, clean effcient and ethical kill. Simple right? It's an especially enjoyable just chilling in a tower or a hide with a few buddies catching up.Now let's talk about the pay wall, shall we? Yes the game is hardly playable as a free to play game. Is it prohibitivly expensive? Only if you're an idiot with no idea how to take advantage of bundles. There are a selection of bundles on the store that offer 3, 6 and 12 month subs respectivly alongside a whole boat load of gear. If you drop the £30 on the top end back you get:12 Month SubAround £50 worth of consumablesA weapon from each catagory and a high powered pistol, as well as ammo and equipment for it.GearHidesStandsTentsThis is as much conent as if you'd bought the game normally. CRAZY I KNOW. It's almost like the company wants to stay in business with such a small demograph. (Let's hope these kids never spot Flight Sim after market prices, eh?)Yet the people knocking this game are more than happy to drop £60 on the latest CoD Map Pack while shouting about this games payment model. It is MORE than possible to buy a single 3 month sub and complete the missions in a few days, giving you around 100,000 GMS (In game currency) which is enough to buy liscences and hunt for free for around a year and a half.)Make no mistakes though, the Free to Play in this game should be considered a pretty hefty, unlimited demo, much like WoWs Free to Play model.If you've ever wanted to actually hunt or want a realistic representation of what it could be like, this game, some buddies and a few hours to kill will be a rewarding and satisfying experience.

411,3597,3600,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewVery promising (casual) battle royale! Looks and plays like a cross between H1Z1 and PUBG, but the hit registration is much better. As Tencent is the publisher (and developer) we have a sort of guarantee of future development, but even as an early access title this is very polished and great fun. The first person models can feel a bit rigid, but the shooting is solid and netcode is excellent. There can be a little stuttering with vehicles, but besides that i haven't experienced a shred of lag or any bugs. Movement is very tight and responsive.There's little else to say at the moment. It's an excellent battle royale game - it also allows up to four players to win in the form of escaping the map with a helicopter, but unfortunately many players will not allow you to get out without a fight - even when there's only four of you left. And the fear of getting shot while approaching the ladder doesn't allow you to let them approach you while making a run for it yourself. But hey, that's Free for all for you.Hackers naturally do exist and especially now that the game has gone f2p. From my experience they are much more prevalent in the squads gamemode than in solo.",1, early access reviewvery promising casual battle royale looks plays like cross pubg hit registration better tencent publisher developer sort guarantee future development early access title polished great fun person models feel bit rigid shooting solid netcode excellent little stuttering vehicles experienced shred lag bugs movement tight responsive little moment excellent battle royale game allows players win form escaping map helicopter unfortunately players allow fight left fear getting shot approaching ladder allow let approach making run hey free hackers naturally exist especially game gone experience prevalent squads gamemode solo

There are 3 difficulties:-Get Real: Its not possible to go around a track without spinning-Amateur: Its kind of okey with keyboard, but the traction control will ruin a lot of your laps-Novice: I havent tried it, cause it contains a braking assistant.The sad thing was, that if the car started to slide, there was basically no chance of properly holding it. Most of the times opposite lock and throttle lift felt like they have no effect at all. In amateur difficulty all cars I tried had horrible understeer ( barely any tiresqueel, though ).The menu system is not userfriendly. If you are used to normal, traditional GUI, then you will have a hard time finding things. After 5 hours of play its still strange, not comfortable to use.On the bright side: The game looks amazing. The challanges can make the game addictive ( so you can find entertainment/motivation to play for  years ). The cars noises and twitches make the atmosphere amazing. You can really feel like you are in the car. In Get Real difficulty there are a lot of settings you can change on the car, so simulator fans can be happy.Summary: I recommend this game for a try, maybe you will love it.

See people complain about them not being banned though at this point if they did ban them it would mostly likely kill the game off completely.. Its just not worth it the game isn't going to live long, unless the devs actually add some more content to the mid game which at this point itsn't going to happen. They also seem to only add new items to the store menu and call that a update seems to me they also have given up in caring about it and are just getting what money they can get out of it.They are just repeating the same things over and over again..

And balance issues  are understandable, I stuck with the game through those issues because hey, its hard to balance a createive game.But the most recent change where all of your income is basically a roll of the dice, no skill required, has done it for me. It's clearly set up so that you can buy ""boxes"" or cash to buy parts outright, but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level.

422,3039,3042,War Thunder,"A lot of people hate the game because Gaijin changed things for the worse. Arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do Realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because Germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. However, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more ""unenjoyable"", I beg to differ all of these negative reviews.Firstly let's start off with my experience. I have at least 400 hours logged from the game before I joined Steam. I've played for about a year now, before steam, so I know what I'm talking about.Okay. So about the game itself - It's a WWII simulation. Arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. Mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (And as of June, tanks) to however you want to have them. There is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - You can add decals, paint the vehicle (After getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc etc.Playing with friends is very easy. Just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. Send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.Another thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. Most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. Ghost Shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. Overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (Look on my video section for a War Thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown). There is little music in the game, if any. It is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/MP3/iPod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. Keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. The other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying (""The enemy has taken the base! We must get it back at all costs!"" - No♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock).Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not SUPERHARDCOREPVPMUSTWIN. Just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like I do. Give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it.",1, lot people hate game gaijin changed things worse arcade increasingly unbalanced premium planes wants realistic wings rip engine failures ammo problems spin outs real planes susceptible germans shot mericans look past fact increasing imbalance caused game unenjoyable beg differ negative reviews firstly let start experience hours logged game joined steam played year steam know talking okay game wwii simulation arguably best damn number years mechanics general great fine tune planes june tanks want higher level customization game people think add decals paint vehicle getting upgrades kinda bs select bombs turrets bullets want plane use depends plane tank etc etc playing friends easy set squadron finding chat send mail add friends list good playing thing combat steadily unbalanced year ago intense drawn time comprised flying actually looking people km away ghost shots issue knows actually aim having use target system shows screen overall combat intense fun damage plane noticeable look video section war thunder intro video lot shots damage shown little music game recommended turn radio pandora personal playlist ipod jam tunes keeping sound effects optional time hear engine sound planes shooting random radio calls annoying enemy taken base costs game enjoyable superhardcorepvpmustwin casual enjoy grand time like shot seriously wo regret

427,5416,5420,World of Tanks Blitz,"This is from davidecz of the WOTB forum.Hi there,i' m here to talk about the premium account.No doubt, with a premium account even if you lost a battle, you got enough credit to still on the race to buy a new tank, no doubt there is no lost, and way more XP.But my point here its to really compare closely the different in game with a premium account or not.The last few week with some good friend we make several test, and we can tell that with a premium a count, your tank, any of your tank its way better in the battle field. Strong, powerful, not easy for the ennemy with no premium to take your down.In the other hand with no premium account you are the weak of the game.

We was making the test shoting each other with the same aim. He cost 9 shots to him before he take my tank down ( he was not on premium account). He take for me 3 shots to take him down! HUGE difference! Then the next day it was my turn with no premium account, and this time my tank was down with 3 shots! And he cost me the same 9 to take him down ( he was on premium account.I can understand that with a premium account you got more credit and more XP, but i really not agree with the difference in the battefield. Premium or not, we should have the same chance. This is not fair at all. I like the game, but not fair between premium account and no premium.Premium or not, tank should be the same.I'm prety sure that some people will answer my post saying that they are not agree, and everybody have right to say what they think, but first saying anything, please grab your friend, and make the test like we do and you'll see.World of tanks its a good game, but should be fair with everyone and not only with who pay premium!",0, davidecz wotb forum hi m talk premium account doubt premium account lost battle got credit race buy new tank doubt lost way point compare closely different game premium account week good friend test tell premium count tank tank way better battle field strong powerful easy ennemy premium hand premium account weak game like friend test shooting got premium account upgraded best gun friend got making test shoting aim cost shots tank premium account shots huge difference day turn premium account time tank shots cost premium account understand premium account got credit xp agree difference battefield premium chance fair like game fair premium account premium premium tank prety sure people answer post saying agree everybody right think saying grab friend test like world tanks good game fair pay premium

Pros -The game is very well optimised so even with my bad ping of 400 as long as the Packet Loss is low you can frag -War Thunder did a good job at keeping realism to a point where it is realistic but not overly till the point you cant have fun-it isnt pay to win as you think, the premium currency can buy you vehicles but usually they are the same as the ones you can grind and unlock with the in game currency, the difference is they give you more Exprience or currency gain -every tank has a weakness , if you think the big tiger was a threat wait till you see it get one shot by an M18 then you will change your mind. -New Vehicles added in presents a challenge for new players expecially in learning on the basics, i really only used my rudder, flaps and etc like a few months into the game and once you do learn you can surpass thousand hour players-nothing is overpowered as i said before, every tank, plane and soon ships will have a heel to step on lets say the russians, in the most common Tier 3 league we have the medium T34 , pretty strong from the front , good armour and a strong gun andddd its gone why? The ammo is located around the middle of the tank literally surrounding the crewmen next up is the Sherman, strong frontal armor the best in its medium tank class , but its side armor is relatively thin and oddly enough the armor plate surrounding the armor bulges out and is weaker than the hull itself huh so yes Every tank has an exploit for you to find , memorise where they are and you will be one of the strongest players in the game -over the years it had begun so much , ive been around before the Ground forces and i havent sunk a single dollar into this game (im poor shut up) and im still actively grinding so yes the replayability is high with this game -This game will look good even on low unless you are one of the ""PC MASTER RACE"" that owns an i3 -F2P , for a constantly updating game Cons - One shots (you and the enemy can do that to eachother you arent op ) - Anti Social community , on servers i have been there is little to no talking in text mostly just people complaning about they got 1 hit or they died from a weird angle - teleporting back to where you were to receive a shell -Team Members may or may not assist you and maybe push you off a cliff either by accident or on purpose ill never know - THE GRIND , its a grinding game which is easy for the first few tiers then you slowly think about buying golden eagles to fund your research because you have been playing the same tank for a few weeks already and you are still so far from getting the next tank in line and then probably when you do you have no cash for it so you grind for cash and the button to purchase it is tempting you -its file space is large so if you are going to need a lot of space for this baby Notes Play with a friend and get a discord going or something , playing with friends is good as you can watch your backs and increase the survival chance of you and allies, the community is funny sometimes so it will cause a laugh or two sometimes during an serious confrontation, there will be badass moments when you are alone and you can score 10 one shots in a row , or clutch the round with a lucky bomb drop from your aircraft either way, this game requires skill and a little bit of luck on your side Recommend Yes , this is probably the best Free To Play to get not many other can compare so i nominate it for the test of time award and 9/10  ",1, sunk hours steam non steam come expecting easy life smooth grinding painted scoreboards mvp ace combat ill narrow die typically die heroic man standing death mean shot pros game optimised bad ping long packet loss low frag thunder good job keeping realism point realistic overly till point nt fun nt pay win think premium currency buy vehicles usually ones grind unlock game currency difference exprience currency gain tank weakness think big tiger threat wait till shot change mind vehicles added presents challenge new players expecially learning basics rudder flaps etc like months game learn surpass thousand hour players overpowered said tank plane soon ships heel step lets russians common tier league medium pretty strong good armour strong gun andddd gone ammo located middle tank literally surrounding crewmen sherman strong frontal armor best medium tank class armor relatively thin oddly armor plate surrounding armor bulges weaker hull huh yes tank exploit find memorise strongest players game years begun ve ground forces nt sunk single dollar game m poor shut m actively grinding yes replayability high game game look good low pc master race owns constantly updating game cons shots enemy eachother nt op anti social community servers little talking text people complaning got hit died weird angle teleporting receive shell members assist maybe push cliff accident purpose ill know grind grinding game easy tiers slowly think buying golden eagles fund research playing tank weeks far getting tank line probably cash grind cash button purchase tempting file space large going need lot space baby notes play friend discord going playing friends good watch backs increase survival chance allies community funny cause laugh confrontation badass moments score shots row clutch round lucky bomb drop aircraft way game requires skill little bit luck recommend yes probably best free play compare nominate test time award

466,3956,3959,Team Fortress 2,"Woo boy, this is gonna be a fun review. TLDR at the end.This is a good game. It really is. There's so much I want to say about it, so I'll get started.Graphically, this game is amazing. Not because it's hyper-realistic, but because the art-style is unique to a point where it's almost impossible for it to look aged. This game is ten years old and still looks great. Gameplay-wise, it's fun. You run around, you shoot people on the opposite team. It's not always shooting bullets though. There are 9 classes, each with their own unique weapons. There are rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers. There are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well. Even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use. The different classes are played in a variety of different ways, so there's probably a favorite class for everyone. And then there's character design. I could probably gush about this for hours, but I won't. Each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette. They are all very unique, to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears. Then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme. The Scout's main weapons are all scatterguns, the Heavy's main weapons are all miniguns, etc. These characters not only have unique designs, but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too. Just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities. It's so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality, and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free. The characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous, but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable. There is probably something to be said about diversity here, especially because of its competitor, Overwatch. There's no dancing around it; this game is simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as Overwatch is. HOWEVER, the characters presented in this game have far more personality than the characters presented in Overwatch. I have played Overwatch before, and unlike this game, was not enthralled by the characters. With this game, I was almost immediately drawn in because of the characters themselves, not just the gameplay. Sadly, however, women designs were once upon a time made for this game, but for whatever reason were scrapped. They were very unique designs too, and if the team actually had followed through on making them and had applied the same effort they did for their male characters, they would have made some of the best dang female characters in gaming.I'm gonna apologize about the Overwatch comparison, but I'm still salty about Blizzard making half-baked female characters and then being touted as ""progressive"" when they're really just playing the middle to attract the most players. The TF2 character designers could make women characters that would crush Overwatch in every way, if they ever decided to do that.There is also something to be said about the community. It sucks. Big time. If you're a woman or have a high pitched voice, you're probably better off not using the voice chat, at least in casual mode. If you do, you'll probably get sexist comments hurled at you, or if they just think you've got a high pitched voice, called a squeaker and might even get kicked. A lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist, sexist, homophobic, and every -ist and -phobic thing in the book into the chat. It's painful to read, but hey, it sure is fun getting dominations on homophobes and then taunting after killing them. So that's something you can do.Of course, it isn't all bad. And most games of this nature end up with a community like that anyway, so it's no surprise really. There are a bunch of good folks out there too. I've met some good folks through this game, and if you play it for long enough, you will too. Just don't be surprised about the bad folks. Plus there's a bunch of different sub-communities that are usually full of nice people.TLDR; it's a good game, and it's free to pick up and play so you've got nothing to lose but your time. It's fun, has a bad overall community but nice little sub-communities, unique and fun characters, and a lot of cool maps. Play it and have fun.",1, woo boy gon na fun review tldr end good game want started graphically game amazing hyper realistic art style unique point impossible look aged game years old looks great gameplay wise fun run shoot people opposite team shooting bullets classes unique weapons rocket launchers grenade launchers flamethrowers variety unique secondary weapons classes use guns unique guns use different classes played variety different ways probably favorite class character design probably gush hours wo character recognizable simply silhouette unique point character model unique teeth ears character unique set weapons usually follow theme scout main weapons scatterguns heavy main weapons miniguns etc characters unique designs unique personalities unique backgrounds listening voice lines play game idea personalities cool game like characters personality characters expanded comics view online free characters probably described extreme ridiculous makes feel real enjoyable probably said diversity especially competitor overwatch dancing game simply diverse character gender ethnicity overwatch characters presented game far personality characters presented overwatch played overwatch unlike game enthralled characters game immediately drawn characters gameplay sadly women designs time game reason scrapped unique designs team actually followed making applied effort male characters best dang female characters gaming gon na apologize overwatch comparison salty blizzard making half baked female characters touted progressive playing middle attract players character designers women characters crush overwatch way decided said community sucks big time woman high pitched voice probably better voice chat casual mode probably sexist comments hurled think got high pitched voice called squeaker kicked lot people casual mode type bunch racist sexist homophobic thing book chat painful read hey sure fun getting dominations homophobes taunting killing course bad games nature end community like surprise bunch good folks met good folks game play long surprised bad folks plus bunch different sub communities usually nice people tldr good game free pick play got lose time fun bad overall community nice little sub communities unique fun characters lot cool maps play fun

470,10295,10299,theHunter Classic,"I find this game to be very enjoyable. It's quite a realistic experience, has a wide variety of firearms and bows to choose from, quite a number of different animals you can hunt, and seems they are adding weapons/animals regularly. Now if you play this for free, without spending money, you will at best be able to unlock only 2 firearms; the .243 single shot that you start with, then a less-than-prestine single shot shotgun which I call 'trusty rusty' because although it's in rough shape, I still find it to be effective enough for hunting. In fact with a shotgun, you can hunt literally any animal provided you have the license to do so and you use the proper ammo (bird shot/buck shot/slug). Also, if you don't spend money, you can only hunt mule deer starting out, then if you do enough missions and get about 6300 gm$, then you can buy the shotgun which will allow you to hunt rabbits as well because you can't do so with .243. From there, continue doing missions, and if you collect enough gm$, you can buy a license to hunt another animal.To put it simply; if you don't spend money, you will only be able to use up to 2 firearms, and it will be VERY labour intensive and time consuming to earn your way up to hunting anything but mule deer or cottontail rabbits. If you do EXCEEDINGLY well in competition hunts, you will be able to earn em$ which otherwise you can only buy with real money. It is THIS money that the vast majority of firearms/bows need in order to be bought, along with callers and camouflage. Personally, I've spent about $40 on the game, and I'm glad I did. I have a $15 3 month membership which allows me to hunt anything, it also gave me a pump action shotgun as well as a .357 Magnum, and the em$ I bought with the remaining $25 or so allowed me to buy a cap and ball muzzle loader, Kar98k, .22lr pistol, longbow, a couple callers, and some good camouflage that makes it harder for animals to see me in the majority of maps. Speaking of which, the maps are huge, with a variety of game to hunt in each one.This isn't a game in which you run around until you see something, then shoot it. Running will make you easy to be spotted, and will thus cause any game that sees you to scarper. There's also the issue of scent, so it pays to mind which direction the wind is going if you're getting really up close to an animal. As with real life, hunting requires patience, it requires accuracy, and it requires tracking (especially if you don't line the shot up right, simply wound the animal, and it runs off while bleeding). If you're looking for a run and gun game, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a hunting simulator, I don't think you'd be able to find a better one than this. This game also has bullet drop so mind your shots if they're 150-200m+, and also it keeps track of the weight of your loadout so it's not like you'll be heading out with 3 rifles, 30 rounds each, every caller you have, along with all the other equipment available to you lolRealism is a big deal in this game, and if that's your thing, as it has been mine for years, then you'll enjoy this thoroughly. Just keep the restrictions in mind unless you're cool with spending a few dollars. For less than $20 though, you get 3 months to hunt anything, along with a pump action shotgun which is all you really NEED to hunt literally everything (Though there are better options out there for long distance shots), and a .357 Magnum revolver which you can hunt red fox, coyote, mule deer, white tail deer, black tail deer, and I think Alpine Ibex (Basically mountain goes) as well as turkeys with. I gotta say, it's kinda fun to sneak through the woods, listening for calls, stalking up on animals as you track them, feeling your heart begin to race as you catch sight of your game, perhaps use a call to try and get it closer, line up that perfect shot, and watch as it either goes down in one hit, or hopefully just runs for a few seconds before collapsing. It's quite an intense experience, and when it goes well, gives you a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.",1, find game enjoyable realistic experience wide variety firearms bows choose number different animals hunt adding weapons animals regularly play free spending money best able unlock firearms single shot start prestine single shot shotgun trusty rusty rough shape find effective hunting fact shotgun hunt literally animal provided license use proper ammo bird shot buck shot slug spend money hunt mule deer starting missions buy shotgun allow hunt rabbits continue missions collect buy license hunt animal simply spend money able use firearms labour intensive time consuming earn way hunting mule deer cottontail rabbits exceedingly competition hunts able earn buy real money money vast majority firearms bows need order bought callers camouflage personally spent game glad month membership allows hunt gave pump action shotgun magnum bought remaining allowed buy cap ball muzzle loader pistol longbow couple callers good camouflage makes harder animals majority maps speaking maps huge variety game hunt game run shoot running easy spotted cause game sees scarper issue scent pays mind direction wind going getting close animal real life hunting requires patience requires accuracy requires tracking especially line shot right simply wound animal runs bleeding looking run gun game look looking hunting simulator think able find better game bullet drop mind shots keeps track weight loadout like heading rifles rounds caller equipment available lolrealism big deal game thing years enjoy thoroughly restrictions mind cool spending dollars months hunt pump action shotgun need hunt literally better options long distance shots magnum revolver hunt red fox coyote mule deer white tail deer black tail deer think alpine ibex basically mountain goes turkeys got ta kinda fun sneak woods listening calls stalking animals track feeling heart begin race catch sight game use try closer line perfect shot watch goes hit hopefully runs seconds collapsing intense experience goes gives satisfying feeling accomplishment

473,6392,6396,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewI want to like this game, I tried really hard to like this game, but it makes it really hard, if not impossible for that to happen. Lets start with the basics, the game has a very big pay to win sort of feeling to it, you dont NEED to pay mind you, but the way the game is set up, it puts you at a big disadvantage starting out if you don't and instead try to use the ingame credits that you accrue slowly during normal play.After that, the maps are huge. Thankfully the developers thought to include bicycles to help you get from point A to point B faster, but thats a whole nother issue I'll get to in a bit. Starting out, the maps seem big, it makes getting around a bit of a pain, but it doesn't seem too bad. You see, your first 3 ranks in the game are spent on 'training maps' or something like that, they are smaller than the average maps, but still pretty damned big. They feel comfortably sized relative to the number of players, although I think they could increase the number of players per side 50% and it would be even better. After your first 3 levels though, you go to campaign maps, and thats where it gets to be painful. Those maps are several times larger, you NEED bicycles or apcs or cars to get around on them, otherwise you'll never see anything, however the bicycles are harder to come by on those maps, meaning you have to hoof it. Thankfully as players progress through the game they can purchase the ability to spawn cars, apc's, tanks, etc. but in my experience, its possible to end up on a server where nobody on your team has them. These maps are so large that the distance between objectives is several minutes at walking speed. That might sound cool, except at least as far as I can tell, the number of players on these maps is no greater than the smaller ones, I've yet to see more than 18 players per side, while the maps themselves are easily the size of larger 64 v 64 Battlefield style maps, it feels like the 'correct' number of players would be more along the lines of 100 per side on these actually, especially due to the fact that the maps are pretty open, meaning that players can easily spend 20 minutes going through the wilderness not seeing anyone, only to pop up behind the enemy lines and just have a good time shooting them in the back... repeatedly... nonstop. Of course, this is something that SHOULD be in the game, but the ease at which its accomplished, due to the fact that at any given time the majority of players on a team will be between their nearest spawn point and the objective they are trying to capture makes it extremely frustrating and it can and does break your momentum and just lead to a frustrated player base.Oh, and those bicycles I mentioned? While nice in theory, they have a serious drawback in that you cannot use your weapon while riding and they make you a HUGE target. You would think that it would be an easy fix, get say 75% of the way there on bike, dismount, and hoof it for the last 30 seconds to where you're trying to go... except on these campaign maps your opponent will usually see you almost as soon as you mount the bike, and they will be firing at you, and probably kill you... and if you do manage to get to that magic 75% mark and dismount, well remember how I said that the opposing team will frequently get behind your lines? Yup, they have an uncanny knack for popping out from behind a tree 15 feet behind you and shooting you dead while you're relatively helpless for the brief couple seconds it takes to dismount.And the other vehicles you can spawn like trucks, apcs, tanks, etc? Those are pretty cool, but again, you have to make an investment to acquire them and be able to use them, something not everyone does, and something which it doesnt seem that the matchmaking service (which is the only real way I've been able to get games... the game does let you pick your battles on the map, but ive yet to be able to get into any when i tried) takes that into account, as i've played on these larger maps where one side was almost entirely devoid of these vehicles, meaning they were forced to walk where bicycles weren't available. In fact, it gets worse, as it doesn't even attempt to balance the number of players with access to things like tanks against eachother. I am writing this, after having just completed a game in which the opposing team had not one, not two, but THREE tanks (mixture of Shermans and Hellcats) against my own teams ZERO, we had nothing larger than a Kubelwagen armed with a machine gun, which is effectively useless against heavy armored vehicles like the ones we were up against. Theoretically this is counteracted by the fact that players can equip themselves with things like panzerschrecks, bazookas, anti-tank mines, etc. but there are two problems with this - the first is that as far as I know this isn't possible DURING a battle, you have to have your loadout, etc. set up before the battle, the second issue is that access to these weapons is a function of both your rank and how much you're willing to pay. Yes, of course you can use the in-game currency to buy a panzerschreck instead of paying out of pocket, but its not really something you want to spend your credits on, as doing so means that you're not spending money on new rifles or weapons modifications, etc. Beyond that, equipping that panzerschreck occupies an equipment slot, which one im not sure, because I (like most it seems) haven't purchased a panzerschreck, which means - theoretically speaking - that you could end up equipping that weapon and ending up on a map where you have no real targets to use it against (I certainly haven't seen tanks very often, and the lighter vehicles like jeeps are easily handled with small arms).  The developers DID however seemingly have the foresight to provide the spawn areas with panzerfausts (and presumably a LAW type weapon for the allies), however that has yet to materialize as a viable solution in the games I've played. Picking up the panzerfaust means you have to carry the panzerfaust, as in it replaces your rifle, so when you inevitably encounter enemy infantry BEFORE you get close enough to actually be able to get a shot off at the enemy vehicle your options are to fire the panzerfaust at them in the hopes that you kill them, or drop the panzerfaust to pull your rifle back out, you'll often be killed before you can manage that. On top of that, the panzerfaust is rarely a one hit kill unless its one of the lighter vehicles like the jeep, and given that its a single fire weapon, that means that firign at the enemy tank won't kill it or necessarily even neutralize it, just damage it, so unless one of your other teammates managed to pick up a panzerfaust (its often not very easy to find), somehow survive long enough to get into engagement range and fire it off, chances are your opponents will have the tank repaired before you have a second shot.Which brings me to my next issue with the game, cover. I love that the game requires you to move tactically to be successful, running in the open WILL GET YOU KILLED. Thats a good thing, I think. The problem is that crouching is terribly slow, and for all the open space on these maps, it will take you a REAL long time to get around that way. And dont even get me started on prone, it might make you harder to spot and hit, but it also makes you effectively defenseless, as you move unrealistically slow, and actually turning around while prone is evidently impossible, so if you need to see whats behind you... yeah, you're going to have to stand back up. On top of that, moving tactically is largely useless when your opponents are just as likely to be behind you as they are in front of you. Most of my deaths come from being shot from my side or rear, likewise most of the kills I have come from shooting someone from the side or in the back, even when I'm in a 'head-on-head' engagement. Anyway, thats all the character limit will allow me to say.",0, early access reviewi want like game tried hard like game makes hard impossible happen lets start basics game big pay win sort feeling nt need pay mind way game set puts big disadvantage starting instead try use ingame credits accrue slowly normal play maps huge thankfully developers thought include bicycles help point point b faster s nother issue bit starting maps big makes getting bit pain bad ranks game spent training maps like smaller average maps pretty damned big feel comfortably sized relative number players think increase number players better levels campaign maps s gets painful maps times larger need bicycles apcs cars bicycles harder come maps meaning hoof thankfully players progress game purchase ability spawn cars apc tanks etc experience possible end server team maps large distance objectives minutes walking speed sound cool far tell number players maps greater smaller ones players maps easily size larger v battlefield style maps feels like correct number players lines actually especially fact maps pretty open meaning players easily spend minutes going wilderness seeing pop enemy lines good time shooting repeatedly nonstop course game ease accomplished fact given time majority players team nearest spawn point objective trying capture makes extremely frustrating break momentum lead frustrated player base oh bicycles mentioned nice theory drawback use weapon riding huge target think easy fix way bike dismount hoof seconds trying campaign maps opponent usually soon mount bike firing probably kill manage magic mark dismount remember said opposing team frequently lines yup uncanny knack popping tree feet shooting dead relatively helpless brief couple seconds takes dismount vehicles spawn like trucks apcs tanks etc pretty cool investment acquire able use nt matchmaking service real way able games game let pick battles map ve able tried takes account played larger maps entirely devoid vehicles meaning forced walk bicycles available fact gets worse attempt balance number players access things like tanks eachother writing having completed game opposing team tanks mixture shermans hellcats teams zero larger kubelwagen armed machine gun effectively useless heavy armored vehicles like ones theoretically counteracted fact players equip things like panzerschrecks bazookas anti tank mines etc problems far know possible battle loadout etc set battle second issue access weapons function rank willing pay yes course use game currency buy panzerschreck instead paying pocket want spend credits means spending money new rifles weapons modifications etc equipping panzerschreck occupies equipment slot m sure like purchased panzerschreck means theoretically speaking end equipping weapon ending map real targets use certainly seen tanks lighter vehicles like jeeps easily handled small arms developers seemingly foresight provide spawn areas panzerfausts presumably law type weapon allies materialize viable solution games played picking panzerfaust means carry panzerfaust replaces rifle inevitably encounter enemy infantry close actually able shot enemy vehicle options fire panzerfaust hopes kill drop panzerfaust pull rifle killed manage panzerfaust rarely hit kill lighter vehicles like jeep given single fire weapon means firign enemy tank wo kill necessarily neutralize damage teammates managed pick panzerfaust easy find survive long engagement range fire chances opponents tank repaired second shot brings issue game cover love game requires tactically successful running open killed s good thing think problem crouching terribly slow open space maps real long time way nt started prone harder spot hit makes effectively defenseless unrealistically slow actually turning prone evidently impossible need s yeah going stand moving tactically largely useless opponents likely deaths come shot rear likewise kills come shooting head head engagement s character limit allow

478,14729,14734,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewIt's been about a year since I wrote the original review. Somehow just about everything changed and I still have the same gripes with the game I had back then as now. Balance issues persist, drones still reign supreme over all other bot types, and matches still feature people who routinely disconnect and other network issues. Meanwhile the main initiative Freejam has taken on improving their game is to advance Robocraft into 'Beta' which apparently entails throwing everything relating to game modes out the window and changing the point of the game from destroying enemy bots to standing on rings, blasting crystals, and endlessly punishing bots with slow mobility. What's funny is that in the face of all that, they only slightly tweaked a few balance points about the more broken weapons and mobilities to be less outstanding (and to their credit, in response to a lot of player feedback over the past several months as well), but the rush and apparent decision to enter beta and somehow trash every single map they had developed for the game up until that point just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything and shifted the game balance even more weirdly off center.There's a ton good about this game - robot construction is flexible and stable enough to let players build in just about any shape or configuration and have a functional fighting machine. A combination of paint and various block shapes allows players to construct bots with legitimately pleasing aesthetics and just really cool shapes. The decisions that players make in setting up their vehicle carry over directly into gameplay as well, with the unexpected structural weaknesses and exposed weapons being prime targets for skilled players to shoot in lieu of 'headshots'. At its core, Robocraft is a game with sophistication and reactive tactics in terms of how to fight with basic marksman weapons, and this is an element of the game that has thankfully survived intact ever since I started playing the game back in 2014 - when there were still cockpits and a weird tech tree. Even with all the new weapons they're trying to push, my favorite guns are the Laser (SMG) and Railgun (Sniper Rifle), which both emphasize careful aiming the most of all weapons. In terms of effectiveness though, Ions (Shotguns) and large Plasmas (Grenade Launchers) currently reign supreme.With everything I've seen, I simply don't believe that's how Freejam sees their own game. I still cite one of their mislead past decisions that thankfully didn't carry through - a recalculated damage system where it wasn't possible to damage components or immobilize enemies aside from just stripping off their whole chassis and vaporizing the whole bot. That was a decision that, if it had actually gone through, would've killed one of the main redeeming factors of its gameplay for me. Reflecting on it, it really illustrates what I think I've come to realize, and it's that Freejam just doesn't know what they want from their game, and still cannot recognize what they're trying to go for. It has no mission statement. Instead, they are mostly trying to blindly follow the leader and seem to be focusing a lot of their attention on making the game more 'accessible' to a wider demographic. That really could just be what Robocraft is, though. They might've just sat down one day and said 'what if we combined Minecraft with World of Tanks?' and somehow it worked for about 2 years. With how much I do like the game's potential, though, I really hope this isn't the case.",0, early access reviewit year wrote original review changed gripes game balance issues persist drones reign supreme bot types matches feature people routinely disconnect network issues main initiative freejam taken improving game advance robocraft beta apparently entails throwing relating game modes window changing point game destroying enemy bots standing rings blasting crystals endlessly punishing bots slow mobility funny face slightly tweaked balance points broken weapons mobilities outstanding credit response lot player feedback past months rush apparent decision enter beta trash single map developed game point kind pulled rug shifted game balance weirdly center ton good game robot construction flexible stable let players build shape configuration functional fighting machine combination paint block shapes allows players construct bots legitimately pleasing aesthetics cool shapes decisions players setting vehicle carry directly gameplay unexpected structural weaknesses exposed weapons prime targets skilled players shoot lieu headshots core robocraft game sophistication reactive tactics terms fight basic marksman weapons element game thankfully survived intact started playing game cockpits weird tech tree new weapons trying push favorite guns laser smg railgun sniper rifle emphasize careful aiming weapons terms effectiveness ions shotguns large plasmas grenade launchers currently reign supreme seen simply believe freejam sees game cite mislead past decisions thankfully carry recalculated damage system possible damage components immobilize enemies aside stripping chassis vaporizing bot decision actually gone killed main redeeming factors gameplay reflecting illustrates think come realize freejam know want game recognize trying mission statement instead trying blindly follow leader focusing lot attention making game accessible wider demographic robocraft sat day said combined minecraft world tanks worked years like game potential hope case

481,8493,8497,Realm Royale,Early Access Review7/3/18 Alpha Build Reviewafter working myself up to diamond 3 and a playtime of 30 hours i figured i should give a little review for this game.rather than listing every single pro's and con's (that are subject to change during the alpha and beta anyways) i am just gonna point out the major things that Realm Royale in my opinion is doing better than every other battle royale out there.#1 - The Forging System : the forging system incentivises you to stay on your toes throughout the entire early to mid game. you are forced to actively look for fights to craft your legendary armor and weapons. camping in this game is heavily punished in the late game as you will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the players that actively did look for kills to craft their stuff.#2 - Map and Circle : with an average gametime of around 20 minutes per match Realm Royale is probably one of the fastest battle royale games out there. the circle actually hurts like hell in this game which means people will rarely unexpectedly sneak up on you from behind as gas camping is nearly impossible in this game. the map itself is relatively small compared to other battle royale games which means if u will sometimes unexpectedly find yourself outside the play zone it is not necessarily a death sentence.#3 - The 5 Classes : in realm royale you can pick between the warrior/engineer/assassin/mage/hunter class which all are unique and fun in their own way. while certain classes like the engineer are easier to get into than other classes the variety of class specific abilities aswell as class weapons creates a very high skill ceiling for each individual class.#4 - Overall Gameplay: unlike other battle royale games that incentivise you to find cars around the map each player has their very own horse they can ride to move faster from forge to forge which as mentioned in point #1 leads to more fighting and therefore low downtime between all the stuff you have to do in this game. the sound effect are very loud. it is virtually impossible to sneak up on somebody as you will be able to hear their footsteps or shots from miles away. this in my opinion leads to less frustrating death experiences as its promotes a fair chance for each participant of the fight.these points alone make Realm Royale the best battle royale game that has been released since h1z1's early beta and offers everything i was always looking for in a battle royale game.- fast gameplay- more fighting than looting- high skill ceiling- no wall building bullsh*t (*cough* fortnite)keep up the great work HiRez,1, early access alpha build reviewafter working diamond playtime hours figured little review listing single pro con subject change alpha beta anyways gon na point major things realm royale opinion better battle royale forging system forging system incentivises stay toes entire early mid game forced actively look fights craft legendary armor weapons camping game heavily punished late game huge disadvantage compared players actively look kills craft map circle average gametime minutes match realm royale probably fastest battle royale games circle actually hurts like hell game means people rarely unexpectedly sneak gas camping nearly impossible game map relatively small compared battle royale games means u unexpectedly find outside play zone necessarily death classes realm royale pick warrior engineer assassin mage hunter class unique fun way certain classes like engineer easier classes variety class specific abilities aswell class weapons creates high skill ceiling individual overall gameplay unlike battle royale games incentivise find cars map player horse ride faster forge forge mentioned point leads fighting low downtime stuff game sound effect loud virtually impossible sneak somebody able hear footsteps shots miles away opinion leads frustrating death experiences promotes fair chance participant points realm royale best battle royale game released early beta offers looking battle royale fast fighting high skill wall building cough great work hirez

The combat is more than just click and go, you have the ability to completely dodge an attack and that makes this game require some actual skill which only a few MMORPG's have. It gives a sense of challenge and doesn't empower those who spend money to a point in which a person who doesn't can't compete with them.

517,10365,10369,theHunter Classic,"I dont think the pricing is unfair. Not only have the producers gone to great lengths to get realistic data about hunting tactics and features and put it all into one game, but its a free to play aswell. Massive array of maps and locations. Sure you need a membership to get all liscences but even guests can join and explore the forests online. Another thing people dont appreciate about this game is the scenery. I think its brilliant. Having bad luck tracking? Dont rush, the rest of the game is awesome. Only downsides for me is:- When animal eyes go behind a tree, that indicates you have a window to move, (In real Life) but it appears there is no line of vision for that.- Animals will see you from a mile away or hear you if running. In this it appears you can run up to them almost 50 m away undetected :(- Rendering: now i know some PC cant render as far as this game goes but most can, Even with high scenery high quality textures ETC you may see in the distance an object looks like a deer. zoom in, replaced by a forrest. Or when you do see an animal, you zoom in there is a log blocking it.- Maybe price a little lower for ingame cash. I remember all those racing games... and deer hunt and candycrush ETC, always make it so you cant proceed without paying unless you can live to attempt levels for another 100 years. DONT be that company ok... Good game so far, people will stop playing if like 99% of the game costs money. all the features combined well over game price. All that can be done now is settle the game prices out as popularity rises.Other than that brilliant game. animals dont de-spawn you can track them for miles. doesnt use as much internet speed to sync online, brilliant graphics and VERY dense grass and plantlife.  honest review.

521,13577,13581,Creativerse,"Early Access ReviewI've never played Minecraft before, but when my wife picked up this game during it's free week, I decided I would check it out as well. It is absolutely FANTASTIC. I played it for about a day and a half before I decided to pay for it, and I don't even slightly regret the choice. It's still early access, and it occasionally shows, but this game shows an extremely high level of polish that i've not seen on some games that are even fully released. The bugs that i've come across are usually small, but pretty regularly re-creatable. However the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook. My biggest problem is with the combat, honestly. It's almost always a battle of attrition, and if you survive, you tend to end up with low health. At that point it's almost better to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your things. Dying is basically a part of the game, so it's good that there's no REAL repercussions for doing so (other than having to go pick up the things in your bag). Some creatures are absurdly difficult, and dodging is almost a complete non-factor. You can, occasionally, find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit, but it's inconsisitent.My 2nd largest issue is the durability of some items in the game compared to the amount of materials required to craft them. The mining cells in particular come to mind. There's one of two ways to solve this as far as I can see: Either make items with durability (like mining cells) last a lot longer, or make the odd materials to make them more readily available. I'm not saying I want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hours of playtime, but I would like to be able to find 5 red flowers without running around for 20 minutes looking at every other tree I find.In spite of this, the game is immensely fun, and you can easily find yourself sucked into it. Digging into your mine deeper, crafting your house to look absurdly awesome, or just exploring the surprisingly vast environments, you'll find yourself readily wondering where the hours have gone. I'd definitely give this game a 9/10, because it's technically not even finished yet. You should definitely check it out.",1, early access played minecraft wife picked game free week decided check absolutely fantastic played day half decided pay slightly regret choice early access occasionally shows game shows extremely high level polish seen games fully released bugs come usually small pretty regularly creatable depth breadth game easy overlook biggest problem combat honestly battle attrition survive tend end low health point better kill run things dying basically game good real repercussions having pick things bag creatures absurdly difficult dodging complete non factor occasionally find good spot dance circle creature hit inconsisitent largest issue durability items game compared materials required craft mining cells particular come mind ways solve far items durability like mining cells lot longer odd materials readily available saying want stone mining cell hours playtime like able find red flowers running minutes looking tree find spite game immensely fun easily find sucked digging deeper crafting house look absurdly awesome exploring surprisingly vast environments find readily wondering hours gone definitely game technically finished definitely check

528,3307,3310,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewI know many people have wrote that this game has bitcoin mining stuff in it or stuff like maleware but don't believe that. As for the premissions you can literally disable all the access RoE tries to get by going to the launcher -> right click -> properities -> security -> edit premissions and deny everything. Been playing this game long enough to tell that it's clean and I checked it with antivirus scan and it's clean. I beleive that most of these negative reviews are made by rival battle royale games. I wouldn't be surprised if pubg players did that just so that it affects the game.Also, as of now, there are no EU servers so when you download the game it will ask you if you're from EU and a bunch of other countries, say ""No"" and you will get access to the game. If you say Yes you will have to close the game and reopen it and the same question will popup. say no to that.As for the actual game play, It's not bad at all, fun but there are few things that they need to work on (which they are) and I believe in the matter of few months this game will be better than pubg.

549,6224,6228,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThis game confuses me. Because it isn't badly done.It's a f2p game, but it's mostly pay2avoidgrind. There are some p2w elements to it, but I've not noticed them have any significant impact on the game. You gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly. I was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing. The interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun isn't actually bad. Infact, it's pretty good. You're essentially a metal box of anti-infantry that can park in any barn you want. It works well and you don't feel crapped on from above just because you're not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash.The weapons are heavily customisable and they actually make a difference. I have an SMG that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it. Wonderful thing since i'm such a crap shot.You can also steal bicycles and give people backies. Which is clearly a major selling point.The game itself is very basic, there's not much to it. It's a WW2 shooter which feels to me like Day of Defeat on Battlefield sized maps. But it's nothing special, just a shooter.But it has me hooked, I've no idea why. The game is average but the fact that it's a f2p game that doesn't feel like i'm forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point. I could use a bigger tank, sure. You gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks. But I don't want to, because everything in this game, from basic gear to bigger gear has it's place.I'm still confused as to exactly what it is about this game I like. Maybe it's just simply because it's hitting all the right notes for a f2p game that wants to include a p2w element but doesn't feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it. Maybe it's because the game is barebones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way?Or maybe it's just because I can steal some American's bicycle for the glorious Fatherland.",1, early access reviewthis game confuses badly game elements noticed significant impact game gain free currency fast unlock gear quickly tank big gun second night playing interesting starter tank machine gun actually bad infact pretty good essentially metal box anti infantry park barn want works feel crapped shelling money unlocking upgrades quicker real cash weapons heavily customisable actually difference smg fires fast person accused hacking wonderful thing crap shot steal bicycles people backies clearly major selling point game basic shooter feels like day defeat battlefield sized maps special shooter hooked idea game average fact game feel like forced pay smirking sit little tank gunning comes near cap point use bigger tank sure gain currency quickly gain unlocks want game basic gear bigger gear place confused exactly game like maybe simply hitting right notes game wants include element feel like monster grind keeping maybe game barebones feels like lot content maybe steal american bicycle glorious fatherland

559,14102,14106,Infestation: The New Z," Infestation: The New Z Review DISCLAIMERThis review does NOT take into account all the controversies about the game development or whatever happened before this release on Steam as Free to Play. As i have seen many other fellow Reviewers being negatively biased towards the game because of tis past controversies, i want to infor you readers that this is not the case. This review is based only on facts and how the actual content is. Thank you.=== RATING: 3.5 / 10 - Let's put Call of Duty and DayZ together, it will be great, i am sure ===- Absolutely essential to play- Recommended playing- Play it if there's nothing better- Play it only if you really are bored- Not recommended playing ->> Just don't, really === The Good - You have a nice storage box with unlimited space to store all your loot, and nobody will be able to touch it. It cripples the whole game balance, but it's good right?- Surprisingly enough, premium membership is very cheap ($1 for 30 days)- Good variety of weapons and equipment to find and loot- Decent number of zombies- Different maps- Battle Royale mode and testing servers to play without losing loot=== The Bad, The Ugly & The Rotten - When you die and respawn, you will respawn very close to where you died the last time. This is an issue because Regular players will have to wait 3 minutes before being able to resurrect and respawn (or pay a substantial amount of credits), while Premium users will revive immediately and without any cost.- Loot is worthless. Piles upon piles of weapons, ammo and gear in any location with spawns. In a matter of a few days you will be able to ammass a true arsenal, and even buy more supplies from the in-game shop, with the money you earned by defeating players and zombies. Since you have a global inventory only you can access, you will never risk of losing anything you loot and deposit there.- Weapon balance is ridiculous. SMGs, Pistols, Grenades and DMRs are useless, the only viable weapons are Sniper Rifles and Assault RIfles. Assault Rifles have bullet dispersion, which will cripple their effectiveness in medium to long ranges severely. They are only viable in close quarters combat. Sniper rifles instead, have no bullet dispersion, most of them will 1-shot any player even with armor, and are semi-automatic with virtually no bullet drop or travel time. In short words, only snipers are good.- You cannot sell the weapons / equipment you do not need. You can't even delete it, it will stay in your global inventory.- Very bad quality of life mechanics. You cannot, for example, take two half spent magazines and make a full one with those. Equipment will stack in the global inventory but not in your backpack. These are just some examples, the complete list is way too long.- Abhorrent technical compartment. The visual impact is just ugly even with maxed out setting. The level is the one of a game came out 10 years ago, maybe more, and is even very badly optimized and will not run on older computers, even if it should. Models, textures and sound design are very low quality.- Only 2 types of enemy zombies: the small common ones, whicha re slow and easy to kill, and then the super one, which is bigger and takes antire 100 round drums to take out.- Premium-only weapon attachments that will be always better than standard ones, making PVP pretty much pay2win even if the developers claim otherwise.- When people die, they will be sent back to the main menu, in which they will be able to get anything they want from the shop or their global inventory, and then revive, as i said before, very close to where they last dies. This means you cannot really defeat someone, they will just keep coming back and never let you loot in peace after being victorious.- Vehicles are utterly useless and overpriced.- No base building of any kind.- Tons of bugs and graphical glitches will ruin immersion and overall experience=== Conclusion Another failed open-world survival that tries to innovate with many mechanics but fails miserably because of ruined game balance and mechanics, and poor technical work.",0, infestation new z review disclaimerthis review account controversies game development happened release steam free play seen fellow reviewers negatively biased game tis past controversies want infor readers case review based facts actual content thank rating let duty dayz great sure absolutely essential recommended play play recommended playing good nice storage box unlimited space store loot able touch cripples game balance good surprisingly premium membership cheap good variety weapons equipment find decent number different battle royale mode testing servers play losing bad ugly rotten die respawn respawn close died time issue regular players wait minutes able resurrect respawn pay substantial credits premium users revive immediately loot worthless piles piles weapons ammo gear location spawns matter days able ammass true arsenal buy supplies game shop money earned defeating players zombies global inventory access risk losing loot deposit weapon balance ridiculous smgs pistols grenades dmrs useless viable weapons sniper rifles assault rifles assault rifles bullet dispersion cripple effectiveness medium long ranges severely viable close quarters combat sniper rifles instead bullet dispersion shot player armor semi automatic virtually bullet drop travel time short words snipers sell weapons equipment need delete stay global bad quality life mechanics example half spent magazines equipment stack global inventory backpack examples complete list way abhorrent technical compartment visual impact ugly maxed setting level game came years ago maybe badly optimized run older computers models textures sound design low types enemy zombies small common ones whicha slow easy kill super bigger takes antire round drums premium weapon attachments better standard ones making pvp pretty developers claim people die sent main menu able want shop global inventory revive said close dies means defeat coming let loot peace vehicles utterly useless base building tons bugs graphical glitches ruin immersion overall conclusion failed open world survival tries innovate mechanics fails miserably ruined game balance mechanics poor technical work

568,5331,5335,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewRemember that time when you were playing a game and thought that ""this game needs a lot more mindless action and fighting"", so, now you have it, and you don't even need to pay for it!! Review:Legends       The legends have repetitive weapons, but each one of them have their own unique skills with them, but unfortunally there as always those guys spamming spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena. The Legends are completly free-o-money, you just need to play A LOT to buy the one you want. The Game has a Weekly rotation of Legends so you can play with 'em all without even buying them.Arenas      The arenas are kinda simple, with some of them that actually has some feature or other. The game itself got kinda of 7-8 arenas, but they all could get an upgrade and new features. All the arenas are spear-spamming friendly, but with the right momentum, you can just tell the sheethead to go away with a punch in his head. Skins      The game gives you the oportunity to have all the Legends with only playing the game, but the skins, just with Mammoth Coins, translating, real cash. I kinda think this is good, because you will only buy the ones you like for the ones you play, but there should be another way to get them, not like CSGO with crates and sheet, but kinda a presential month listing, that if you get all days ingame, you could trade for a skin, buuuut thats just me.Gameplay      Consist of the 'Couch', the 'Single Player', the 'Online' and the 'Ranked'. The cool part of them all is not that you just play by yourself, this game brings back the good 'ol same-screen co-op gameplay, meaning, you can add more than 1 player in one PC, for me, this is actually awesome. The game consist in killing everybody else in the arena, be it in teams or F4A (Free-For-All). All Legends have 2 weapons, and can still just brawl their brains out with their fists.End:     For all of you whom are reluctant to play this, i shall tell you: LETS FREAKING EXPLODE THEIR BRAINS WITH FREAKING MASSIVE ROCKET SPEARS!!!9.5/10 ",1, early access reviewremember time playing game thought game needs lot mindless action fighting need pay review legends legends repetitive weapons unique skills unfortunally guys spamming spear rotation let arena legends completly free o money need play lot buy want game weekly rotation legends play buying arenas arenas kinda simple actually feature game got kinda arenas upgrade new features arenas spear spamming friendly right momentum tell sheethead away punch head skins game gives oportunity legends playing game skins mammoth coins translating real cash kinda think good buy ones like ones play way like csgo crates sheet kinda presential month listing days ingame trade skin buuuut s gameplay consist couch single player online ranked cool play game brings good ol screen co op gameplay meaning add player pc actually awesome game consist killing everybody arena teams free legends weapons brawl brains fists end reluctant play shall tell lets freaking explode brains freaking massive rocket
569,14573,14578,Robocraft,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewHonestly This game Is a great concept and visually it works. There is alot to be said that is good about such a game, the voxel based construction and all its great its wonderful, but that is where it stops.The developers have repeatedly and continuously turn the game on its head since I started playing (before it was on steam) yes some changes arguably are and were merited but in general they have made many poor decisions and continue to keep making poor decisions. The game has been out well over a year and they claim they are still ""One step Closer to Beta"" as they launch their latest patch of poor decisions. These recent patches like most of the others have affected balance, destroyed the matchmaking system, and uterly decimated the economy. Expect to play 200-400 matches to build a fully functional robot with matching parts. Free-Jam does not admit to their mistakes, fix problems ,or even really listen to the community that despite disagreeing still want to see the game to succeed and come to fruitionIf you have been playing this game for awhile yeah you can still occasionally have fun as you already have the parts and the game-play and building still retains most of its appeal. But if you are new to the game I suggest looking elsewhere, you  are in for lots of seal clubbing by more experienced/better armed players, and rewards from battle that will keep you the unfortunate prey for many many many games to come.Maybe some day the Devs will mature and the game will stabilize, but until then I cannot recommend this game.",0, product received freeearly access reviewhonestly game great concept visually works alot said good game voxel based construction great wonderful stops developers repeatedly continuously turn game head started playing steam yes changes arguably merited general poor decisions continue making poor decisions game year claim step closer beta launch latest patch poor decisions recent patches like affected balance destroyed matchmaking system uterly decimated economy expect play matches build fully functional robot matching parts free jam admit mistakes fix problems listen community despite disagreeing want game succeed come fruitionif playing game awhile yeah occasionally fun parts game play building retains appeal new game suggest looking lots seal clubbing experienced better armed players rewards battle unfortunate prey games come maybe day devs mature game stabilize recommend game

Most puzzlingly, Eternal preserves what is usually acknowledged as one of Magic's biggest flaws: the resource system.  While every other Magic-esque game has sought to improve the system that Richard Garfield came up with in 1993 when no one had ever done this before, Eternal changes nothing.  Meaning you can look forward to games where you lose because you didn't draw enough resources, and also games where you lose because you drew too many resources and not enough business cards.  This was a source of RNG that even *Hearthstone* thought was too swingy and unfun.  If you like the idea of having a certain portion of your games decided because one player drew his cards in the wrong order and thus didn't get to play much at all, then go for it.But I kind of expect better foundation-level design from card games made in 2016.",0, early access reviewif looking way play magic gathering online barely functional official client game recommend game straightest ripoff mtg seen puzzlingly eternal preserves usually acknowledged magic biggest flaws resource system magic esque game sought improve system richard garfield came eternal changes meaning look forward games lose draw resources games lose drew resources business cards source rng hearthstone thought swingy unfun like idea having certain portion games decided player drew cards wrong order play kind expect better foundation level design card games

No company in their right mind are going to lose money out to another company without A:  getting good money back, or B: they are not doing successful.With a game like this,  seeing it going on steam is a pretty bad sign that its already tanked and they are just shoving it on steam in hopes of raking in whatever pennies they can before just flat out abbandoning it.

585,4146,4150,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"This is probably the best Yu-Gi-Oh! game on pc, that said it still has many flaws. I'd say they did a good job recreating dueling from the card game, it's pretty fun when it's against normal decks. But it's ruined by meta/pay2win decks, if you play PvP 9/10 duels will be against meta decks. If you want to get good cards, you either have to buy them or farm for hours to get them. In the events you just fight the same opponents over and over which just shows that the devs are lazy. The game was ported from phones so the sides of the screen are just to fill space with basically useless information. I wouldn't recommend this game, it's only fun the first few hours when you're buying cards and trying them out, after that you just farm with the same cards for a long time until you get enought gems to buy other cards.

588,6364,6368,Heroes & Generals,"After having spent enough time on it (>1000 hours) I can say I have mixed feeling with this game.On the plus:* The idea of mixing RTS map and your own units with a battle in the FPS, it's GREAT. Nothing I have seen before and the main strength of the game.* The weapon system and its improvements it's addictive so you keep playing to unlock and improve some weapons/vehicles.* Did I say how great is mixing a RTS with FPS?On the minus.The main problem I'd say is EXECUTION. Things in this game don't work as they should. I will explain this:* The RTS game is terrible, the interface, the performance, the graphics... everything is awful and slow, you cannot group your units, you cannot sort or search them, the only way is micromanaging. It doesn't matter what computer you have, this will be laggy and slow. It looks like it was designed by students 10+ years ago.* The game balance makes no sense at all. The game is not realistic at all neither properly balanced. So you find germans have the best weapons and then RETO suddenly decides to improve their weapons with no explanation at all. There are many examples regarding to this.* The lack of maps. Although there are several big maps, after some days you will notice you are all the time playing the very same maps, trough different lines but 80% of War game will be in Town or Mountain Town. 2 Maps.* The engine/performance. The graphics look old, they cannot afford any comparison with any 5 years old game but even though the performance is laggy and bad. I play it with GTX 1070 and even sometimes the game is not smooth. I'd say that developing your own engine with small resources is a huge mistake.* The stability is terrible. I have never seen a game that needs to be restarted so many times. Every couple of hours you will have CTD no matter what* The development policy is also total madness. A perfect example: there are 4 big maps although 80% of battles are played in only 2. You would think the first priority is creating new maps right? No way, RETO will release new sounds, new planes, nonsense weapons modifications (most of the time with no notice, aka ninja update) and many other ""useless"" things instead of MAPS.* Tanks are a joke in this game. I really don't know how to fix it but a Tiger II shouldn't be scared of every infantry soldier they see on a motorbike. Overall impressionWith all these defects, issues and missmanagement. Heroes and Generals it's an exceptional game, don't get me wrong. The idea, the core idea of playing an FPS with your own troops and follow the progress in the RTS is outstanding. The problem is that is the only strong point of the game, the implementation of it it's really poor. I would love to see this game managed by a more professional/bigger company (I don't want to say Reto is not professional but they are clearly short on resources so the game gets old, unstable, poor on performance, unbalanced... and their priorities makes no sense from my point of view) I have to add that late changes done by RETO are following a better direction and they finally implemented some really needed features like giving orders to several AT's at the same time.FutureThis game will die soon (I don't want it but I think it will happen, I still have 1 year veteran) . People have a limited amount of patience and while RETO mostly provide players with promises and poor results, other games appear and they don't do the same mistakes. I really hope this idea of FPS/RTS will be properly implemented by a big company. They will make tons of money.",1, having spent time hours mixed feeling game plus idea mixing rts map units battle fps great seen main strength game weapon system improvements addictive playing unlock improve weapons vehicles great mixing rts minus main problem execution things game work explain rts game terrible interface performance graphics awful slow group units sort search way micromanaging matter computer laggy slow looks like designed students years ago game balance makes sense game realistic properly balanced find germans best weapons reto suddenly decides improve weapons explanation examples lack maps big maps days notice time playing maps trough different lines war game town mountain town maps engine performance graphics look old afford comparison years old game performance laggy bad play gtx game smooth developing engine small resources huge mistake stability terrible seen game needs restarted times couple hours ctd matter development policy total madness perfect example big maps battles played think priority creating new maps right way reto release new sounds new planes nonsense weapons modifications time notice aka ninja update useless things instead maps tanks joke game know fix tiger ii scared infantry soldier motorbike overall impressionwith defects issues missmanagement heroes generals exceptional game wrong idea core idea playing fps troops follow progress rts outstanding problem strong point game implementation poor love game managed professional bigger company want reto professional clearly short resources game gets old unstable poor performance unbalanced priorities makes sense point view add late changes reto following better direction finally implemented needed features like giving orders time futurethis game die soon want think happen year veteran people limited patience reto provide players promises poor results games appear mistakes hope idea fps rts properly implemented big company tons money
589,11714,11718,Bless Online,"Ok, I've seen enough. Let me start from the beginning. I really wanted to like this game. I've been reading about it way before premiere. I was hoping for something trully fresh and mindblowing. Instead of that, we've got... this trash.I know I've spent only couple of hours playing, but if game don't want me to try its content then I uninstall it.PERFORMANCE ISSUES. It's one, big lagfest. It may be ok somewhere when no one else is, but then try to visit some locations with other players (not to mention bigger cities). Game runs terribly and it's not a fault of my pc. Other (even newest) mmos run smoothly.I've got stuck three times (inside wall, floor, stone) and each time I had to use recall stone, and run all the way over to the place were I got stuck. Once I fell over the map. I could watch freefall of my character as textures went up to the sky.QUEST & EXPING. There's almost no exp for killing monsters so it's better to leave them alone and just run from one quest to another. I could understand that if the quests were fun. Oh my god they are not... Run couple of minutes from one npc to some place, do something for 3 seconds and run again to the same/another npc. So if quests are mostly running and killing monsters make no sense, what else can I do? I've heard about dungeons but I don't have enough patientce to level up anymore.COMBAT. This is another issue for me. Maybe not for everyone, maybe it's just me. Unfortunately combat is one of the worst I've seen in a while. Boring, unintuitive and simply not fun. But whats the reason in making it fun if You don't even want to kill any mobs, right? POSITIVES. I really liked character creation. Plenty of races and classes. A lot of different options of body shapes, faces, hairstyles, colors etc. All that You need to create Your unique avatar.Graphic are also pretty decent. I stopped couple of times just to watch something but You can see that game engine has couple of years. It does not explain why my computer has so much trouble with fps. I will say it again. I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I've waited before buying it and I'm glad that I din't spend any money on it. I finally tried it on free to play and after 3-3,5 hours it getting out of my disc. Seriously, try anything else. Maybe there're not a lot of new titles but this one is simply not worth it.Not to mention best mmos (like WoW, GW2, FFXIV, ESO etc.) or even this average (Neverwinter, Aion, Archeage etc.), it's even better for You to try something like ""Riders of Icarus"" or ""Revelation Online"" then something like Bless.PS.

591,14867,14872,Robocraft,"I played both the original robocraft and the one currently available on steam. The original one had and Experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and lbocks with exp you earn, after which you could buy these blocks with creddits you would earn or with money. During the building of your bot your tier level would increase, which would influance which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against. Battle were fought somewhere between 10 v 10 or 12 vs 12, but could be randomized (like 6 vs 9) depending on how strong the bots were. Battle was fought world of tanks style. One life, one enemy base, one friendly base, and go.New version has different battle modes, of which the main mode is a conquest based map with 3 different points to capture, and respawn enabled. There is no Exp system, and no tier system. you have a maximum of 2000 points to use, that's it. Blocks can be bought, with points (slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own.. don't know the numbers but seems like 20% or so of it's original worth) or with money. they can also be earned with... our all time favorite ..... lootboxes. Now, the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember Really enjoying the old verison. And to be fair, although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round, the new battle mode is still fun, going around with bots. Building is still the same (appart from the tiering stuf), and it's fun to build. However, what put me off was the ridiculous amount off ..... I would describe it as ""Rubbing it in"" that you are not currently a paying customer.Some examples:When recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get 4 times as much dust if you were premium.When opening lootboxes, which you do get at a fair rate (1-2-3 a match), you open 8 blocks, weapons, etc. off those, you receive the bottom 4, the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying Unlock with premium.I would say i am resistent in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it, more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented. But this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every 10 minutes.In short, Fun game, went in the wrong direction, still fun but not worth the trouble if you don't intend to get premmium.",0, played original robocraft currently available steam original experience progress system unlock different weapons lbocks exp earn buy blocks creddits earn money building bot tier level increase influance opponents roughly searched battle fought v vs randomized like vs depending strong bots battle fought world tanks style life enemy base friendly base new version different battle modes main mode conquest based map different points capture respawn enabled exp system tier system maximum points use blocks bought points slowly earned recycled parts know numbers like original worth money earned time favorite lootboxes reason came new steam version remember enjoying old verison fair battle multiple enemies retry round new battle mode fun going bots building appart tiering stuf fun build ridiculous describe rubbing currently paying customer examples recycling unwanted parts dust points blinks screen times dust premium opening lootboxes fair rate match open blocks weapons etc receive closed neat sign saying unlock premium resistent buying things spend money certain developers deserve donation actually buying stuff presented game forces evaluate spend money minutes short fun game went wrong direction fun worth trouble intend premmium

But now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. I started playing while they  still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy ONE plane... ONE! You'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles.

602,13472,13476,Creativerse,"Early Access Review Review as of Version R33, written August 4, 2016. TL;DR: 10/10 great game, involved and responsive devs. Details below. Worth your time! :)Creativerse is a voxel-style, open-world, construction-and-survival game by Playful Corp. It's available through Early Access on Steam, and if its current state is any indicator, it's poised to be a genre-defining title. both due to game quality and the outstanding performance of the development team.Graphically the game is superior to others of its type. The visuals are crisp, detailed, and contain dense, well-saturated color palettes. Block textures are equally detailed and colorful. The patterns mesh beautifully without gaps or mismatches between blocks. Most objects can moved on a 3-axis rotation, allowing complete control over placement and alignment. Movement and animation are smooth and natural.Game worlds are 10,200x10,200x256 in size. While that is hard to visualize just by the numbers what it means in practical terms is that worlds are large enough to feel vast and expansive, and have room for the most ambitious of builds a player could conceive, while still being manageable if one wishes to move across them from border to border. The development team struck a great balance between size and practicality with those dimensions.There are numerous biomes in game worlds, each containing blocks appropriate to them along with creature spawns that match the biome theme. Biome temperature does have an impact on players, and the things they build - spend too much time in a hot or cold environment and you'll take damage from the extreme temperature. Hot zones will melt ice and snow blocks; open flame can burn your thatched walls down; Cold zones will turn that lava fall you built into a solid wall of stone. Finding all the ways temperature and biome affect you, and how to enhance or counter those effects, is one of the interesting parts of game play.Game worlds also have several layers, with an underworld at the base, with a lava layer on top of it, transitioning through more layers to the surface and beyond. Large bodies of water exist on all worlds. The game has its own physics, including mechanics for throwing, jumping, and falling. The first time you fall from a titanic tree and face-plant into the ground really teaches you to watch your step, and adds a sense of tension to those high-wire acts we love to attempt on top of tall objects.Creatures are an important part of the game, offering a sense of a living world, resources, combat, and the survival aspect of the game. they range from harmless wandering beasties to juggernauts of doom. Keep your sword handy, wear armor, brew some health potions, and remember that cowardice is always an acceptable option. Luckily you can build a home that will keep you safe, and even build explosives to toss over the walls at anything as a way to say ""Get off my lawn.""Block variety is solid, and growing. When the developers find a gap in the block roster they tend to fill it, and they add new, beautiful blocks regularly. A quick trip to YouTube can show you some truly beautiful builds, showcasing just what can be accomplished with the existing block set. I can only imagine what amazing things will appear in the future.Speaking of the developers, they are as amazing as the game itself. Updates are frequent and expansive. They pay closer attention to player feedback, particularly on the Steam forums, than any other developer team I have seen. They regularly interact with players there when time permits. New and exciting features are added constantly. When problems occur their responses are swift and the problems are addressed thoroughly. They are everything a player could hope for in a developer.I highly recommend the game, and recommend the purchasable PRO upgrade. The upgrade is a one-time purchase that includes a nice set of convenience features like expanded inventory and some enhancements to stamina so you improve your mobility. They did a great job of adding a nice upgrade pack that enhances game play. I've supported the game and can't get enough of it. It's definitely a 10/10 game and I hope you'll play. Once you do, message me on Steam and show me your cool creations.

607,3999,4003,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I have ever owned. It's face-paced comedic FPS that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more. The nine classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy) have their own traits and balances that make the game fun, such as backstabbing (Spy), running faster than the other classes (Scout), and being able to rocket jump (Soldier). With tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team, each round is never the same, so it never gets boring (unless one is playing Deathrun).Team Fortress 2 is also been known as a ""Hat Simulator"", which it basically is, considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield. Their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain. The game has it's own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh.If one is Free to Play, then one has the choice of being Free to Play forever, or buying something from the TF2 Store and becoming Premium. The game does not force the player to buy something from the store, although the downfall to being Free to Play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make ""[F2P]"" appear at the front of your name. But these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such.I fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fast-paced FPS that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle. I recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage. To me, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game I have bought on Steam today.",1, team fortress fun games owned face paced comedic fps addicting way making want play classes scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper spy traits balances game fun backstabbing spy running faster classes scout able rocket jump soldier tons different weapons random number classes team round gets boring playing fortress known hat simulator basically considering cosmetics class wear battlefield different kinds combinations hats miscellanious cosmetics know kind combination obtain game humor characters create game cause laugh free play choice free play forever buying store premium game force player buy store downfall free play trade people servers appear minor things player bypass player wants play game hats fully recomend game wants fast paced fps likes laugh switch comedy intense battle recommend like cosmetics classes look awesome way different varieties stats weapons change classes health vulnerability strength damage team fortress favorite game bought steam today

624,7684,7688,Trove,"I used to play this game long before it came out on Steam. How, you ask? Glyph; Trion's own, less-great launcher for the game. This game did entertain me for a decent number of months, and its where i actually met some online friends that i still interact closely with to this day. Yet, despite it being our origin, we all quit the game relatively early, and i'll tell you why:Trion's servers are actually some of the worst ive ever seen. Trion's servers seem like they'd have an easier time taking on a tag team of ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan in a cage match to the death than keep my client connected. Countless times during boss raids, my game would lose connection, wasting the key i used to enter and placing me at the game's spawn area. Other minor server-related problems include teleporting  of you, other players, enemies, and once in a rare while, loot that drops can ALSO disappear completely.Trion is much more focused on bringing out new content than fixing bugs (or their servers). Oh cool, a new class! Oh cool, dragons! Oh cool, an entire new biome! Oh cool, fishing! So now that we've got all these amazing things, you guys are gonna make fixes to bug that came with the new things, right?........right?Now, what's my biggest problem with this game? It's not the lack of interesting changes, the lack of bug fixes, or the plain ignorance of the needs of the community; its how much of a total bleepin' cash grab this game has become.When this game released on Steam, the only things available for purchase were purely cosmetic items; skins for your characters and the like. Post-Steam release, the was like the apocalypse of ""bundles"" and ""mastery points"" and all this other mumbo-jumbo that really added a fine layer of salt for me. And not the good make-your-food-taste-better salt. We're talking the turn-your-food-into-poison road salt.Between Trion's lack of communication with their community and all the new desperate attempts to make a quick buck, this game has easily become pay-to-win, and offers about as much entertainment as watching your mother break down into a sobbing mess after you had asked where daddy went.",0, play game long came steam ask glyph trion great launcher game game entertain decent number months actually met online friends interact closely day despite origin quit game relatively early tell trion servers actually worst ve seen trion servers like easier time taking tag team macho man randy savage hulk hogan cage match death client connected countless times boss raids game lose connection wasting key enter placing game spawn area minor server related problems include teleporting players enemies rare loot drops disappear completely trion focused bringing new content fixing bugs servers oh cool new class oh cool dragons oh cool entire new biome oh cool fishing got amazing things guys gon na fixes bug came new things biggest problem game lack interesting changes lack bug fixes plain ignorance needs community total bleepin cash grab game game released steam things available purchase purely cosmetic items skins characters like post steam release like apocalypse bundles mastery points mumbo jumbo added fine layer salt good food taste better salt talking turn food poison road salt trion lack communication community new desperate attempts quick buck game easily pay win offers entertainment watching mother break sobbing mess asked daddy went

While the voice acting is some of the best that I've seen in an mmo, with what seems to be the entire main story line fully voice acted, the actual text in the game appears to just have been tossed into google translate. The game still remains unoptimized, and it shows; opening menus causes the game to stutter and freeze. Combat is very awkward, and was ultimately the deal breaker for me; it feels like they began with a tab targetting system, and then last moment decided to change it - ultimately settling on what can be described as DanceDanceRevolution combat. The combo's seem very sluggish, requiring me to hammer on keys far to many times to ensure that the skill actually goes off. Overall I'm not impressed, and I had such high hopes for this game after playing the korean version of the game a few years ago.

630,16247,16252,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"So let me break it down. World of guns: Gun Disassembly is a unique 'game' if I've ever seen one.You start off with a classic Kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt, not much of a spoiler there. but yeah.The game is all about unlocking things; Field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly, dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly... Assemble to operation, operation to game, game to super game and super game to hardcore game. You can geuss what the first three are; Operation is using the various features on a gun, changing handgrips, firing it, attaching a silencer or even folding a stock. The games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together, you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint. On super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.You might be thinking ""okay thats easy"" well... I've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. A few times the game screws you over by saying ""YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST"" even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.Example: You need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. One gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. But this particular gun needs both to be on.Its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.On the graphics end of it. The outside of the gun, looks awesome. 10/10 texturing. On the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. This means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. Honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. No complaint unless your obbscessed with HD textures.On the of the guns themselfves. TONS of variety. I find quite a few guns I like in their collection, however... I need to sift through alot of guns I don't cary about at all just to get to them. Sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? Well, i'll tell you: total access. Unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. Because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. Sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. So it makes playing fairly hard to do. Also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, I do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. Plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. The graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to CS 1.6 esque graphics. AKA Crappy world textures and okay gun textures.There is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).First is coming back every day. Don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. But make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.Next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. I managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. I have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of XP to use on unlocking guns. But, I can't use it because it's broken.Last method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)Quizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more XP you get to walk away with. Get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for 2 hours.The funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. It will however (even though I got all the questions right) lock me out for 2 hours. Its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet I get none of my earned points. It only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. CRAZIEST THING IS... If I fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all. I feel like they're trying to keep me from getting points... Cheeki Bastards.Anyways I'm reinstalling, still voting positive for this game.

631,12250,12254,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewBless had a really rough start. There were loading issues, fps drops, lags etc. A lot of people left and started creating hate videos on youtube. But devs really stepped up and fixed all of those issues in matter of two days. Loading issue is gone, FPS improved, lags are gone and there are more servers now. They even compensated us with a lot of ingame currency and events.Just remember how other games were at launch, even those published by huuuge companies. D3 was unplayable for 2 weeks (constant disconnects), BDO had FPS issues, lags and overcrowding resulting in being impossible to Quest and so on...About the game, it's a good one. Combat system is very interactive thanks to combos etc., it's more skillbased than just mashing buttons. Devs are working on balancing the combat, so it's more about skill and the fight is a bit longer. Graphics are not bad, textures of anything about characters (face, armors, weapons) are pretty good, the world is as in any other MMO, not bad, not amazing (but scenery is cool). There is end game content missing, but some of it is being released today and rest is coming during next two weeks.Overall, devs are working on it, trying to fix the issues and they work fast.

633,7447,7451,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"The card draws are absolutely not random. Maybe 95% of my losses I've had turn out like this:No possible moves for the first three turns, playing catchup and hoping I stop drawing either duplicates of multiple cards I can't use for six turns or only drawing exact same type of cards I don't need. (In one match, by turn 2 I literally drew 5 of my 6 item cards in the beginning of a match, with no one to equip them) Then after surviving the ensuing slaughter with less than ten health, stage a miraculous comeback, chain around 10 cards together and whipe out most of the opponenets board, only to have my opponent 'randomly' draw precisely what they need to win that turn. Being defeated with two full lanes after starting with a worthless hand is antithetical to a good game. I don't know if it's an attempt to keep W/L ratios even (which is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic anywhere) but from the beginning of many matches it's clear who Legends has picked to win. In those situations I've only come out on top twice, both times because my opponent made a fatal mistake.Deck based card games never have decent RNG, this one is no different.

638,4527,4531,SMITE®,"I really wanted to like this game. But this game doesn't have a learning curve. It has a learning cliff... ...One hundred stories of jagged broken glass that slams you in the face the moment you install it and enter the first menu. You'll enjoy it from the moment you install and see the pretty graphics until you actually try to play it. At that point it's all downhill until you find the only other enjoyable part, uninstalling it.If you like reading more than playing, getting stomped by heckling high ranking opponents. Being one shotted by characters that mark you from across the map and then one-shot-kill you. Then this game is for you....The good: graphics. It's free. You can unlock all of the in-game content that affects the gameplay for free.The bad: Long wait times to play. No one using voice. No in-game explanation of the vast number character abilities, items, relics, and set up options. Several encyclopedias worth of information to read before you can play any character and actually win.Every character has access to a hundred items, each with multiple stats, passives, and auras. But if you want to know what works for one character and not another you have to sift through pages and pages of guides made by the community.Oh and by the way, there are three or four game modes and no one build works for all so be prepared to do that for every character, class, and game mode you want to play. Five classes. Almost 100 gods. Three primary game modes. A different build for each god in each game mode. You do the math.And to top that off - Plenty of high ranking players that like to build premades and pub stomp.

651,15035,15040,Robocraft,"Early Access Review(there's an unbelievable tweet by seb I'll link at the end of this review.)TLDR: The game had a golden period, and dipped below iDubbbz eating peaches in a sewer. Don't play.This game is the equivalent of an indecisive 5 year old who wants to be everything on Halloween, with constant bursts of unrealistic ideas.Robocraft at one point had a decent ranking system, a good currency system, and basically a good everything else. It seems as if the developers didn't see what promise they had, and consequently shoved the whole thing down a toilet full of polished turds. There seems to be a misallocation of priority, with all of it going towards radically changing the base game rather than actually listening to the players, and fixing the game.The old tiering system worked fine, along with the different tiers of armor you could have. It gave a clear difference between the tiers, and actually was something to work towards upgrading. The currency system was also working well, as it didn't give too much money to the point progress was too easy, and never too little to make things seem impossible. But, literally all of that got thrown out the window in favor for absolutely worthless crates and pay-to-win mechanics. The weapons long ago actually had a clear difference as to what they were used for, but again, it was thrown out in favor of new weapons that you're encouraged to buy with real money.If you've heard the saying, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" you could very safely assume the developers haven't.Almost everything this game had was golden, but it seems Freejam has caught some sort of contagious mental illness amongst it's staff, and as a result their game was thrown down the company ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and repeatedly defecated on. There is literally /ZERO/ ideas being taken from the community, despite what their numerous announcements say. Not a single mind wanted these changes, Freejam.In short, stay very well away from this game until some miracle worker comes along and fixes the game, or that mental illness Freejam caught subsides.seb's tweet: https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726734941178990592 ",0, early access unbelievable tweet seb link end game golden period dipped idubbbz eating peaches sewer play game equivalent indecisive year old wants halloween constant bursts unrealistic ideas robocraft point decent ranking system good currency system basically good developers promise consequently shoved thing toilet polished turds misallocation priority going radically changing base game actually listening players fixing game old tiering system worked fine different tiers armor gave clear difference tiers actually work upgrading currency system working money point progress easy little things impossible literally got thrown window favor absolutely worthless crates pay win mechanics weapons long ago actually clear difference thrown favor new weapons encouraged buy real money heard saying ai broke fix safely assume developers game golden freejam caught sort contagious mental illness staff result game thrown company repeatedly defecated literally ideas taken community despite numerous announcements single mind wanted changes freejam short stay away game miracle worker comes fixes game mental illness freejam caught tweet

653,3800,3803,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2, where do I even begin...The trading?The gameplay?THE HATS?THE CLASSES----------------------------------------------------There's the Scout, the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the Heavy, the Engineer, the Medic, the Sniper, and the Spy. They all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily, nearly kill you, or just annoy you to death.The Scout is the fastest class, with his Scatterguns, Pistols, and his Bats, and he is also able to double-jump in the air.The Soldier wields a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a Shovel, and is the second-slowest class.The Pyro wields a Flamethrower, a Shotgun, and a Fire Axe, and is a mysterious person, whose gender is still unknown.The Demoman wields a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle, and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking.The Heavy wields a Minigun, a Shotgun, and since he is oh so manly, his bare Fists, and he is also the slowest class.The Engineer has a Shotgun, a Pistol, and a Wrench. He is able to build Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters, to help attack the enemy team and support his team.The Medic wields a Syringe Gun, a Medigun, and a Bonesaw. He's a medical ""expert"", and his Mediguns can heal the team and Ubercharge them, which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time.The Sniper wields a Sniper Rifle (no surprise there), an SMG (submachine gun), and a Kukri (a big knife thingy). He's Australian, he's got his sights on you, and you're his next target.Finally, we have The Spy. French. Elegant. Sneaky. A lady-killer metaphorically and a literal man-killer. He has his Revolver, his Knife, and his Sapper, which he can use to destroy the Engineer's buildings. His Knife can kill any enemy in the game with a Backstab (do I need to explain what a BACK-STAB is?), unless they are Ubercharged or if a Sniper is wearing the Razorback, which blocks backstabs.**NOTE: These are just stock weapons! There are tons of different weapons for you to try out! Mix and match, baby!**THE GAMEPLAY----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is often times a very fun, competitive game where you can snipe, stab, shoot, or stun, through different weapons and different classes (talked about above). There are often ""two groups"" of TF2, the P2Ps (Pay to Plays) and F2Ps (Free to Plays). P2Ps are often known for having many cosmetics, valuable weapons, and skill, while F2Ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you're a Spy. (My personal experience is that most F2Ps I meet are actually quite good players.) With many maps, many gamemodes, and many players, you're bound to have a good time. Why not try some cp_powerhouse, or maybe ctf_doublecross? Perhaps pl_bananabay?-What is Competitive Matchmaking?-Competitive Matchmaking means that you're put in a server with other players as good as you, like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This was much requested by the community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players, or players much much better than you. Prayers were answered in the Gun Mettle update with the introduction of matchmaking!UPDATES----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is sadly being slowly updated, but these new updates often come in with the big guns. Some of the more recent updates as of January 1st, 2018 are the Smissmas 2017 Update and Jungle Inferno Update. There are also other major game updates from the past, especially the Uber Update, Love and War update and the Mann vs. Machine update. Many of these updates often have a Source Filmmaker (SFM) video to introduce these updates and their features, such as the Meet the Medic video for the Uber Update, the Expiration Date video for the Love and War update, and the leaked Invasion video for the Invasion Update. Some updates instead get a comic, such as the Gun Mettle update. Some of these events only last for a period of time and aren't permanent.-What do these updates introduce?-Some of these updates, in particular ones like the Love & War and Uber updates, introduce bulk amounts of new items like cosmetics, weapons, and other items like paint for your hats and unusual effects to look good in! Up until the Jungle Inferno Update, no new weapons had been added since the Tough Break updated in *2015*!Thanks for reading my review :3",1, team fortress begin scout soldier pyro demoman heavy engineer medic sniper spy variety ways kill easily nearly kill annoy death scout fastest class scatterguns pistols bats able double jump air soldier wields rocket launcher shotgun shovel second slowest class pyro wields flamethrower shotgun fire axe mysterious person gender unknown demoman wields grenade launcher stickybomb launcher bottle man liver shriveled died years ago drinking heavy wields minigun shotgun oh manly bare fists slowest class engineer shotgun pistol wrench able build sentry guns dispensers teleporters help attack enemy team support team medic wields syringe gun medigun bonesaw medical expert mediguns heal team ubercharge invulnerable short period time sniper wields sniper rifle surprise smg submachine gun kukri big knife thingy australian got sights target finally spy french elegant sneaky lady killer metaphorically literal man killer revolver knife sapper use destroy engineer buildings knife kill enemy game backstab need explain stab ubercharged sniper wearing razorback blocks stock weapons tons different weapons try mix match fortress times fun competitive game snipe stab shoot stun different weapons different classes talked groups pay plays free plays known having cosmetics valuable weapons skill dismissed terrible players understand happen chase map thinking spy personal experience meet actually good players maps gamemodes players bound good time try maybe competitive matchmaking means server players good like counter strike global offensive requested community players end good player server filled terrible players players better prayers answered gun mettle update introduction fortress sadly slowly updated new updates come big guns recent updates january smissmas update jungle inferno update major game updates past especially uber update love war update mann machine update updates source filmmaker sfm video introduce updates features meet medic video uber update expiration date video love war update leaked invasion video invasion update updates instead comic gun mettle update events period time updates updates particular ones like love war uber updates introduce bulk amounts new items like cosmetics weapons items like paint hats unusual effects look good jungle inferno update new weapons added tough break updated reading review

706,14447,14452,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewI tried to like Robocraft. I really did, but too much of this game is money-oriented. The game mechanics were very unique and quite interesting, but you get new items randomly out of crates. I, as a long-time TF2 player, do not have a problem with this, but again, as a long-time TF2 player, I don't like how getting more powerful weapons faster means spending money. Premium? Money! You want another crate without playing? Money! You want to buy your weapons? MONEY!Being a new player, what really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was how unbalanced the items vs levels system was. Sure, to put more items on your robot meant needing a higher level (somewhat indirectly), but that's about where that ends. You could buy, say, a target-locking missile launcher, and one or two rotor blades, and there you go! BEST ON THE SERVER.I find that fact a little depressing, especially since all this means I could've enjoyed the game a bit more if I had some money to spend on it, but I don't.I don't know what I was expecting. Another good F2P game? Of course not. What I get is this mess of a game. Robocraft isn't worth your time.

708,3616,3619,Team Fortress 2,"2010Team Fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. First of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. Instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like Heavy, Soldier, and Scout. The vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the Heavy is the slowest, the Scout is the fastest, and the Medic is normal speed.Classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. The Medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. This will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the Solider, is faster than the medic.The level design is beautiful, but Take Two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. But some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line,The fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. Of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. For example, the Heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the Pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. It seems similar to Mario Kart, with the various courses and powerups. However, it fails to capture the fun of Mario Kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and blandThe major flaw in TF2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. There are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. Valve did include a ""map"" that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. These maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.While the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. I wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this PC-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.",1, fortress decent racing game vehicles game somewhat strange instead licensed vehicles stuff like heavy soldier scout vehicles different rights example heavy slowest scout fastest medic normal speed classes game slightly broken medic class vehicle near useless serves purpose teamed second vehicle serve slow immensely healing heavy let teammate healing away teammate solider faster medic level design beautiful attempt create immerse beautiful world forgot types tracks suitable racing taking place areas underwater long corridors intelligence rooms levels racing finish line fun thing vehicle weapon players course players wearing vehicle colors example heavy weapon literally takes sight slows halt pyro weapon sets fire fourth similar mario kart courses powerups fails capture fun mario kart instead going ultra realistic direction looks boring blandthe major flaw direction going checkpoints wrong way markers valve include map changes tracks confusing beneficial maps nearly identical anyways changing maps seemingly randomly serves aggravate players tracks graphics fun creative racing game lacking ways recommend game game owners access console pc racer try hard stand crowd

717,17007,17012,Cuisine Royale,"Early Access ReviewCuisine Royale is a parody game of most battle royale games out there. Despite being a parody, it's actually one of the best battle royale games. I've played Fortnite, PUBG, and some other battle royale games. Despite that fact, I still think this is the best battle royale game out there.The art style is great. As a history lover, me and my friends all like the WWII setting and it's good to see what the game they're working on will become. The way the animations work is hilarious and goofy, purposefully, is great and it fits the design perfectly. The idea of protecting yourself with kitchen gear as a man in his underpants is comedic, and definately helps the game show it's a joke game.Even though it's a parody, it's better than PUBG. The gameplay is great, and is way faster than PUBG, and is less boring. A cuisine royale match takes 1/4 of the time that a PUBG match does, and you'll have more fun playing it. The game is fast-paced and gets your blood pumping, and it's realistic style helps it's surreal atmosphere. The gunplay is pretty solid except for some rather questionable times, and it remains to be fun even after multiple matches.In total, the game is great and I think it plays really well.

722,4428,4432,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"Winning or losing is entirely determined by your connection error, or rather the server's connection which is so flimsy it could go either way. The game lags and has a lot of talking npcs and unncessary click steps yet has a timer. Which means they must've intended the game not to be played as Yugioh, but as a completely arbitrary gamble and the Yugioh cards are there for aesthetic and to trick idiots into buying gems.Overall it is more balanced than real Yugioh, but that's because real Yugioh is everything you should not do in a card game. With so much dependent on first hand cards, spells/traps only existing as complimentary utility, and a lot of power creep from set to set, it wasn't hard to make this game at all more competitive by just tightening the board and changing set rotation down to hand selected cards that aren't all that good in the real format. What this is, is Yugioh where they only correct their own bad game design by limiting cards that broke the real game as either extraordinarily rare (again, to trick idiots) and leaving the meta complete hogwash because of consistency constraints and tight board management making a lot of archetypes obsolete.Yugioh as a game is all about the rareity and power creep of a card, so in essence this ""fixes"" that by making♥♥♥♥♥♥servers that run on a Atari 500 and insuring most players never even see the really broken stuff they've made over the years. But if you're expecting to duel hardcore, make friends, do really anything besides wait around for the server to crash and get a loss for it... you'll need to play another card game. Which I can't even recommend to you one because the industry is just so unconcerned with improvement and actually in-depth gameplay they're all just as bad.

742,11748,11752,Bless Online,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI've been holding off on saying anything for a while at first in hopes it'd improve, then I just wasn't sure how I could ever fully put into words how disappointed I am. Let me first say that I really cared about this game a lot, I had high expectations, I had hope despite the hate before the game released. I played this game in 3 different betas, the first time being the Russian obt. I cared so much that I applied to be an emissary and was shocked when I found out I was selected. I'm sorry to anyone I convinced to buy this game, it bares on my mind at times that people have bought this game because I convinced them to, I helped this company get players into their game and con people out of their money. Lets start with the optimization, this game was never optimized it always ran horribly. They knew this for years. I like everyone else thought ""hey it's only temporary"", I've played MMO's with somewhat bad launches before with a turn around. They made a mountain of promises and never wound up delivering on any of it. They launched this game with most of its content stripped, then proceeded to act like this was new content they were releasing to try drawing peoples attention away from the fact they weren't doing♥♥♥♥♥♥about this games optimization. Initially they were at least kinda trying to fix the balancing issues with classes and plague of bugs, but looking at the update history they've given up. The reason being they conveniently announced recently that they're re-releasing this game using Unreal Engine 4 to the console market, so no they're not going to do anything about this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ They did however, say this game will be going free to play and I guarantee you they're going to make this game pay to win and try to milk every cent they can out of their shop before closing down. This game costed Neowiz so much money that I think their only goal after a while was simply to try and scam as much money as they could to recover their losses. Would not be surprised if this game ends up bankrupting them and they 100% deserve it. Do not buy this game, stay as far away from this company as possible. Valve needs to recognize this game as a scam and refund everyone who paid for it. Anyway, further, let me tell you at one point despite the optimization always being an issue, this game was way more fun a couple years ago. Originally they were kind of making a selling point that this game was supposed to have market appeal to the west. In order to do so you need to have a game that mechanically isn't another generic Korean p2w grindfest. Honestly, they succeeded at first. This game felt more similar to WoW mixed with maybe some ESO or GW2. Abilities weren't chained, you had access to them all and could mix and match, then you could choose 1 of 3 stances and that'd boost the power of abilities related to that stance. It gave you a lot of customization. What happened was people were complaining the combat was too slow. In all honesty, certain classes were a bit slow, but not all of them and the ones that were was due to the time it took to cast abilities and recovery time after casting them. All they had to do was shorten or remove the casting/recovery issues and this game would've been way faster pace. Other classes kinda had some balancing issues that needed some work. Arenas and the siege, could be queued for whenever you wanted just like WoW, you had a lot more freedom with whatever you wanted to do. So, in the Japanese beta abilities still worked the same, but instead you had this skill tree that you see in this version of the game that allows you to put points into certain abilities and it'll improve it in 1 of 2 ways. Pretty lackluster because the improvements on all abilities improve the same 2 ways. On berserker specifically it either increases the damage of the ability or increases rage generation, but it does that for every ability which is rather boring. It was clearly early testing of how they were going to change the combat to what it is and this was only a few months before NA was getting its release. When we were going to get ""overhauled combat for NA release"" to fix the pacing issues, the Japanese version of combat is what I thought we were getting. What concerned me immediately though was they were already starting to add restrictions to what you were allowed to do, arenas and the siege now had a time gate. Pretty much ruined the game for me then, but I was hopeful they'd realize it's a stupid change. Itemization works different too, but idk the specifics on it because I didn't stick around in this version long enough to find out, it was originally like I was saying before more like WoW/GW2. Balancing was nothing like this pos is, broken yes, but the combat was fine, it just needed to be cleaned up a bit.  So fast forward to release, we end up with what we see now which is beyond obvious they came to as a result of running out of both time and money so they rushed a poorly thought out combat system and resorted to turning a truly westernized Korean MMORPG into another pos Korean MMORPG, but at least Korean games are normally optimized and don't look and play like crap. It's like they last minute decided lets try to make a really bad version of Aions combat, make it grindy, and add some no fun allowed time restrictions on everything. This all happened within like a year, what a downfall. I can deal with bad optimization, I can't deal with bad mechanics and combat. Had they shipped an improved version of the Russian game I think they would've had more initial success that would've lasted a little longer...I would probably be playing it still but that's up until the point they showed what a horrible company they are and how little they truly care about this game. I was so disappointed at what we got, that the vast majority of the time you see I have played was only to login and report bugs and complaints for the CM's, I didn't even wanna be an emissary at that point and slakcked off. Maybe at some point Neowiz did care, but they just dug themselves too far into a financial pit because of the cost and how long it was taking them to finish this game. I'm truly disappointed, I really thought this game would go far, I really enjoyed it, it had huge potential, and now it's going to be a DoA title with a sullied name. I hope when this game gets canned someone out there with a soul and passion for games will buy the IP and make this game what it could've been, if it can ever have a chance again even with a new developer. RIP Bless, had I known this was gonna happen I would've played my heart out during the Russian OBT instead of waiting for NA release. Maybe one day when I finish college I can be the one to buy the IP and form my own team and revive this game, one can dream right?*This game as of now has yet to ""officially"" release and that was actually one of the reasons I defended it, but what to take away from my and other peoples posts is this companies rampart lying and over all shady practices. What you see in this games EA has changed very very little since and being so close to release is what the final product will be. When this game goes F2P and you see these reviews, know what company is running it. Don't waste your time, they're not going to fix it because their focus is on scamming a new market.

747,13497,13501,Creativerse,"I finally decided to review this game, should have done so a long time ago lol. This game is extremely fun to me and I do recommend it. Its a nice up and coming game that reminded me of a 3D Terraria. I never played Minecraft or any other game similar to this one, so to me this is a fun game. I created a small world with a few friends. Enjoyed exploration quite a bit. My only complaints are that the game had some severe lag issues no matter what rig you have. I have a friend with like a 3k gaming computer and he was STILL lagging in this game sometimes to the point where it just wasnt worth even building at all. It was overlooked due to how fun the game is in general. The new blueprints system they added to the game increased the fun by an unimaginable amount because you can share your creations with the world now pretty much at the click of a button and then go build someone elses cool stuff or even just make it your own somehow. Over all, the game has a few flaws but there just wasnt anything to really make me say this game isnt worth playing for anyone who would love to play a sandbox game where you build to your imaginations limits. The game could use more enemies in it. Alot of the enemies are reskinned and recoloed enemies. But to be fair this game isnt really a game you go looking for a fight in so I don't think that matters much.You can visit SO many open worlds and see others creations for free and see how amazing the game can really be. There are some worlds that have been around since the beginning of the games inception from what I can tell, and those servers are absolutely amazing to log into and see. From entire cities inside and out to gigantic trees spiraling up into the sky so far the game doesnt even finish loading it for you till your like halfway up the tree. There is some really cool stuff to see if you love creativity in general. And the community is extremely nice, no matter where I went people were usually really nice and helpful to new players. And I know on my own world I always had enough in stock to help a few new players. The biggest thing I liked about this game was how I did not have to host a server to have a world. My friends could come and join my world even if I was not present. I had found a way to do that on terraria but for the most part id have to be online in some form to host on terraria and it got lame cuz nobody could ever do anything without me seeing it. But in Creativerse there were times Id log on and suddenly, there is a giant castle off in the distance where a mountain once was, or a temple built into a tree, or mines dug all throughout the ground and lights put up for safer travel..and once..even a roller coaster built that just went around for a bit and shot me off into a lake cuz reasons. Either way, the experience was much more fun due to this for me. The in game shop seems fair honestly, the prices they ask for things do not seem overpriced for what you get at all (as long as you are buying the building block sets...I would NEVER recommend buying the in game items with real money, I found I can make all the items in the game pretty quickly once you know where to go and set up farms and such...so paying for consumable items just was never a good idea. However, paying for the premium blocks I agree with, fair price. permanent addition to your characters ability to build them and just over all worth it to me. I spent a decent amount of money in the game but thats because I found the game so fun in the time frame I played it with my friends that it was well worth the money invested to support a good game. I hope you enjoy it too :)Oh...and I tamed my own personal Leafi army to follow me around and we shall rule the world some day...Maybe.....I dunno...but at least they will look cute trying!EDIT: I recently ran into troubles with the blueprint system they have in game, I was shorted a pretty extensive amount of blocks out of one of them and had to contact thier support crew. As it turned out, thier support crew is literally just one person. When I discovered this, I fully wholeheartedly expected to have to wait days if not a week or two to actually get a reply, instead, I got a reply in less than 6 hours alongside a fix and compensation for the troubles.

757,9715,9719,Elsword,"To be honest, no one should have the right to write a review other than me. As you can see, I have over thousands of hours into this game. Who can make a better review than I am, right? Anyways, let’s get started with this type of Pay to win type of genre game. Elsword is a pay to win game period. No matter what other people will tell you otherwise if you don’t pay a bit of cash, you would almost guarantee of no progress into the game. You think I’m joking right? WRONG!!! If you don’t believe me, try for yourself! Don’t say I didn’t tell you. Just remember that no kids should use their parents’ credit card. Let’s move on…there are items in the item mall which are a must for your gaming experience. It would cost around $30 bucks or some for beginners. Why $30? Well, items like more skills usage, etc. I am not going to list them all since it will beat the purpose of this review. $30 is just the beginning, and then you probably need better equipments and other things to make your character a bit stronger, which could approximately cost around $10 – infinite amount money because it depends on luck. Yes, this game is totally casino base type of things. So, expect to get a lot of frustration when playing this game. I will not go into details as why because again it will beat the purpose of this review.  Most of my friends are all already quit because of that if not sold their accounts. There are other things as well which I don’t know if I should say it; whatever, I’m still going to say it…. It is their customer service. When you have a problem with your related game support, the GM or customer support simply copy and paste their usual statement as a way to answer the question. You hear me right, it is a copy and paste statement that no matter what types of questions you ask them the answer is always the same unify one. It sounds weird but that’s how they do their responses. All in all, I’m still playing this game not because it is fun but because I spent crazy amount of money and I don’t really want to waste what I’ve given down.  The only celebration that I will do for this game is when is you know what happens.  Or, if I get all my money back which I doubt they will do.My last question to wrap up my review is if you make this game your life, oh boy I can’t imagine what would’ve happened if this game you know what happens.

758,6494,6498,Heroes & Generals,"My ""Review"" of Heroes & Generals. AKA: Things I like and things I don't like...Let's start positive. Things I Like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter- It has character customization that isn't too unrealistic (except for some weapon skins)- It has everything you'd expect: Different weapons, vehicles, 3 factions and different classes, progression. - They give out the odd free item. - Shooting is enjoyable (I only tried 2 weapons though)- There are weapon and character upgrades. Things I don't like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter...so expect bad team players, connection/server issues, premium currencies and premium status that grants a bonus to xp (basically making you unlock better weapons quicker. Quite unfair)- Your starting gear as the US: An M1 Garand...that's it. You have to level up to unlock a knife, pistol, grenades (you know, things every soldier had that aren't really as handy as a rifle). Ultimately, this makes matches so god damn dull. I never once thought I'd begin to get bored of the M1 Garand sounds but when all you hear is *puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping* for an hour straight, it will drive you mad. - Battles are really empty. So much so it seems too quiet to be a battlefield. Again, dull. - Wow, I can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform. But wait, I'll only ever see it in the menu, what's the point? Hell, when changing helmets, the display doesn't even update. - I have great internet connection. Played a lot of multiplayer matches in other games. Not one issue. This game? Rubberbanding every 15 ♥♥♥♥in' seconds. I played almost 2 hours and it was infuriating. Literally no other game I own has that issue. - Saving up for that one class you want isn't going to make the game any better. I had just about had enough of the connection issues and decided to play until I could afford to play as a Paratrooper (Band of Brothers style). Did not help. Very disappointing animations for the character and the plane, not to mention you can get shot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who looks up. And, saving up for that character ended up giving me LESS options to customise. - Stamina system. For a soldier, you really can't ♥♥♥♥ing run far. The Generals part? You have to put a lot more hours in than I did. I love strategy games and I've played thousands of hours of them on here and I'm 100% sure I would have been disappointed with that mode too. - Most things in the trailer/screenshots barely happen and obviously been set up. Except for that stupid♥♥♥♥♥cycle. Every time I see a German Tony Hawk, I focus fire on his silly♥♥♥♥♥as he struggles to turn the damn thing. Driving reminds me of Garry's Mod addons. I really wanted this game to be at least decent and satisfying. And although I won almost every match I played I was still disappointed. Would not recommend. I'd prefer to buy my friends any Brothers in Arms game instead of wasting their time with this cheap trash.",0, review heroes generals aka things like things like let start positive things free online character customization unrealistic weapon expect different weapons vehicles factions different classes progression odd free item shooting enjoyable tried weapons weapon character upgrades things free online shooter expect bad team players connection server issues premium currencies premium status grants bonus xp basically making unlock better weapons quicker starting gear garand level unlock knife pistol grenades know things soldier handy rifle ultimately makes matches god damn dull thought begin bored garand sounds hear puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping hour straight drive mad battles quiet battlefield dull wow change colour helmet colour uniform wait menu point hell changing helmets display update great internet connection played lot multiplayer matches games issue game rubberbanding seconds played hours infuriating literally game issue saving class want going game better connection issues decided play afford play paratrooper band brothers style help disappointing animations character plane mention shot sky gun looks saving character ended giving options customise stamina system soldier ing run far generals lot hours love strategy games played thousands hours sure disappointed mode things trailer screenshots barely happen obviously set stupid cycle time german tony hawk focus fire silly struggles turn damn thing driving reminds garry mod addons wanted game decent satisfying won match played disappointed recommend prefer buy friends brothers arms game instead wasting time cheap trash

766,6680,6684,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewHave been following this game for some time and spent a good few hours playing it.. Coming back after a break playin Smite and Overwatch I feel no motivation for playing. The maps are dark and gray, the loadingtime is terrible to say the least. Even though I love WW2 type of games I find their ""War"" mode to be in a constant state of inbalance. Airplanes are terrible to control properly and the physics of the game driving cars and tanks around is just terrible. Some of the weapons they add to the game makes no sense. The Russians are given a rifle that can pick out light armour tanks like nothing.The UI has become even worse then what it was before. There is now layer uppon layer with chat windows, Squad information and all other kinds of nonsense making you feel lost if you where new to the game. Introducing friends to this game takes them about an full hour just understanding the basics. And last but not least. Micro transaction and a terrible grind to get access to new gear.

767,11216,11220,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewIt's like Hearthstone, but with a lot more rewards and strategic complexity.

However, the core card-game gameplay is a lot of fun, and the game is extremely well-balanced in ranked mode and also has a very fun draft mode, both of which shower you in rewards (roughly a pack per day if you reroll quests, and each pack has like 10 cards). Unlike Hearthstone, the devs are very liberal with a nerf bat, and really unlike Hearthstone, they actually buff garbage tier cards all the time!

This quote from the developers is pertinent: “We're committed to offering players the best card game we possibly can...and that's hard, and messy, and takes time. Onboarding players gradually helps us make sure that the game you're playing is the one we set out to make, and the feedback we get from our growing player community helps us chart a course for launch.”Bottom line: there is the potential for a great game here, but right now (July 2018), there remains a lot of work to be done. I cannot truly recommend this game as I played it, but I am not going to not recommend it. Give it a shot, you might find it works better for you!First big issue: why is my Steam log-in not enough for this game? Why do I need to create a seperate account for it? Other game developers have managed to combine their games with Steam log ins. Please try to do the same!Second issue: in the latter parts of the free/unregistered tutorial, some of the cards did not function as indicated that they would.

808,13166,13170,Fallout Shelter,"I would like to start by saying the game does have a good overall concept, and I believe that the issues here can be fixed.The biggest reason I find the game unplayable is that combat is very confusing. Frequently, you will get raids by sword weilding samurai. They don't come for resources, they just come to kill your survivors, and suck their soul into a pokeb- sorry, wrong game. If an attack does happen, your characters just kind of stand around and do nothing. You can equip weapons and all that, but the effectiveness varies. You also have to manually move either the weapons around between characters, or move your characters to the room under attack. This could be improved if the survivor AI is updated to automatically seek out and destroy threats, and to automatically move to rooms under siege. It would also be kind of nice to have more mechanics in the underground. In XCOM, you build chambers very similar to the game here. In XCOM, geothermal caves will spawn underground which provide extra electricity if you build a power plant on it. It's little things like that which could really add to the game's playability. So summing up, I ask that Bethesda makes combat more fun, and less confusing, as well as adding a few mechanics to give the player a reason to keep coming back. It's that thought of, ""gee, I can't wait until I can build my base up to reach this cool looking location.""",0, like start saying game good overall concept believe issues fixed biggest reason find game unplayable combat confusing frequently raids sword weilding samurai come resources come kill survivors suck soul sorry wrong game attack happen characters kind stand equip weapons effectiveness varies manually weapons characters characters room attack improved survivor ai updated automatically seek destroy threats automatically rooms siege kind nice mechanics underground xcom build chambers similar game xcom geothermal caves spawn underground provide extra electricity build power plant little things like add game playability summing ask bethesda makes combat fun confusing adding mechanics player reason coming thought gee wait build base reach cool looking location

812,5884,5888,DCS World Steam Edition,"DCS is an amazing game if you have the patience and mental capacity to learn and remember all of the systems and how to use them on the specific aircraft that you want to fly, and once you do this, it'll be implanted into your mind and you'll have fun. If you want to get into air-to-air engagments, then go for the F-15C. If you want to get in to air-to-ground engagments, then go for the A-10A, but if you wan to fly a plane almost exactly as it is flown in real life, then go for the A-10C. The main difference in modules like the A-10C and the F-15C (besides them being two completely different aircraft) is the interactive cockpit. This means that the A-10C has a cockpit with buttons that are almost all clickable and all carry out the same function as the real life counterpart. Other than that the modules all have the same realism level meaning that they handle and behave very realistically both in combat and free flight missions.I give this game a 9.5/10 rating because you have a somewhat limited selection of planes to fly, but this isn't an immediate problem because by the time you learn how to utilize a plane's capabilities effectively in combat,  you won't want to instantly jump into another because you probably won't be interested in making yourself commit suicide.Warning:DCS is not a game, it's a simulator. You can't just load it up and play with no learning period. If you want a game like that, then play Ace Combat.

814,2941,2944,War Thunder,"I´ve played this game for quite some time now, as you can see. And while I proceeded in the game, I started to notice some very bad things. Firstly, the grinding: I understand that it takes some time to unlock a new vehicle, but without multipliers it took me almost two months to unlock the Tiger, in the German tech tree, but its only in the middle of it! The grind also is very frustrating, if you research a vehicle but you dont have enough money to actually BUY it. I once spent a big amount of ingame money to level up my crew until I was pretty much broke. I thought I could regain that money with playing some matches, but the exact opposite happened. Since that time I ve been in a constant state of poverty or extreme grinding.Secondly, the matchmaking and battlerating-system. Both dont work an are complete nonsense. Example: My Tiger H1 has the battlerating 5.7. There are many vehicles with this battlerating or just some that the Tiger actually fought in WW2. Do I get to fight these? No, of course not! It could be to easy for me! I got uptiered to 6.7 EVERY time! And which tanks are on this battlerating, you may ask. The Tiger 2 for example, but also Tanks like the Pershing. The second of these was desinged to kill Tigers in one shot and withstand their 88mm gun. So, could I as a Tiger kill a Perhing? From the side at a 5m distance maybe, but never in a head on fight. In addition to that I have to say, that there is a russian bias in the game, because the grind for russian vehicles is much shorter and you can just go in like: RUSH B♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thirdly the historical accuracy: This also has an impact on point 2. Many vehicles, that never or rarely fought each other, have the same battlerating! So youre going to fight them. This is very frustrating, cuz sometimes you fight a 50s MBT like the Centurion MK 1 in an early 1942 Panzer 4. I dont think I have to elaborate this point any further. I just want to say that my Panzer 4 is at 4.5 and the Centurion MK1 at 5.7 (the same BR as the Tiger, which he also never fought, but was desinged to defeat it).Fourth point: Air combat. In one sentence. Boring and empty, also with massive uptiers and ahistorical fights.Conclusion: It is no bad game, in fact I like it very much, but it needs some big fixes and balancing.

I just started playing Creativerse and have been almost instantaniously gripped to it. It's an awesome game to play with friends. Seeing as Creativerse is still in ""Early Access"" I am looking forward to what the creators have in stock for the players. There is always something that draws you and makes you want to keep playing. The feeling of killing a monster you haven't encountered before and seeing what it drops is one that I don't really see in other games. This game is unique and is highly commendable. It deserves to start off with a bang. I honestly am very excited and have great anticipation for the future of Creativerse. I strongly recommend getting it. Props to the creators.

818,307,309,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,"Early Access ReviewFun for a quick jump scare, Quite a long game for a completely free to play game. It starts off cutesy but soon gets darker (in lighting and tone).7/10Review:Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a fairly fun 'horror' game. It starts with a rather cute looking ghost 'spooky' telling you to traverse the rooms of the mansion, Along the way you'll see cute cardboard cutouts of octopi and ghosts. As you get further into the mansion you will meet other monsters that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl.The only real downfalls this game has is that it is rather repetitive, as it is jump scares after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speeding through each room and majority of the monsters are just slow chasers so you can just outrun them. It does have some different sections amidst the repetitive-ness such as a space-like section, a rusty school section, etc.It's mainly a shame that after room 760 there is nothing new (for now) as the developer has a message pop up stating that from then on it is incomplete.",1, early access reviewfun quick jump scare long game completely free play game starts cutesy soon gets darker lighting spooky house jump scares fairly fun horror game starts cute looking ghost spooky telling traverse rooms mansion way cute cardboard cutouts octopi ghosts mansion meet monsters chase jump scary fashion slime monster ghost girl real downfalls game repetitive jump scares short lose edge scariness end speeding room majority monsters slow chasers outrun different sections amidst repetitive ness space like section rusty school section etc mainly shame room new developer message pop stating incomplete

836,2382,2385,Path of Exile,"Got allmost 2k hours in this game, and i can still figure out new ways to play and build the chars i make and that means a lot for a player like me that is allways trying to figure out something nobody else has done. The massiveness of the game and the constant updates from GGG makes this game allways fresh.GGG has created originality in the sense of there desire to keep inflation out of the game economy which they have done by making every item in the game a currency in itself. Skills are items you find and use in sockets which means skills is a tradeable currency to.Every skill can get enhanced by support gems you link to them, as an excample fireball linked with chain making the fireball chain between targets. There are a lot of different gems and a lot of different ways to combine em. and deserves a try from all gamers out there.You can play this as a casual player, or as a hardcore player that desires the competive scene.At the first glanse of the skill tree in this game it might seem that you will never learn it, but in my oppinion it is far from as hard as people make it to be.Events are being created runningly to keep the game exciting besides the new leagues that last for longer periods at a time. With every new league they create new prices for both the hardcore racers and the casual players that just want to get the achivements or challenges to earn a price.Path of exile has gotten some critisisme for the famours ""Desyncs"" since the release.With the version 2.0 on the door step GGG has made an official statement they are adding a new network model to the game to fix the issue it has caused for some players.On a more personal note on that matter, i have died to em myself but over my hours of path of exile i have learned to avoid the desyncs you can cause in the game, so for me the desyncs is not a problem anymore. But i understand it can be an annoying factor for some players.A quote from GGG themselves:Wraeclast is a dark, brutal continent. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it.We're sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs. The art style we chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic. Wraeclast is terrifying, and we've tried hard to do it justice.In Path of Exile, replayability is key. All world areas including outdoors ones are instanced for your party and randomly generated, right down to the magic properties of the monsters that dwell in them and the treasure they guard.I coulden agree more.

I had a bigger framerate at ultra than at high, weird.Free-to-play?Yes it is free-to-play and FREE-TO-WIN. There are some paid elements in the game such as skins and guns but you can get them with the ""free"" currency you gain by playing. The paid ""stuff"" has no impact on gameplay, they are only cosmetics.Suggestions:I suggest a competitive mode because the demolition (5v5) is very similar to cs:go, and that is a good thing. I like the tactics you can make as a team and its just amazing to play this game, but its not very rewarding. If you win a game you got some xp and coins (i think) but if it was competitive (it can be just as it is, who reaches 8 points win) but it could have some ranks, like bronz, silver, gold etc.Overall i would say just try it.

849,8485,8489,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewI started playing a few days after release. It was phenomenal.Realm Royale (RR) has the best BR concept. It brings shooters and MMO's together within a BR universe. The class aspect is not even its biggest selling point. It was, notice past sense, the concept: incentive to hunt other players. Players would drop currency to craft better weapons/gear.Unfortunately there were a couple of poor choices. The games' current state is too rng focused despite the fact elements were added that already were reverted the first time they chose to add them. The direction of this game is not clear. What is clear is that the playerbase gets smaller after every poorly chosen change.This game has the potential to be very, very big.

862,2583,2586,War Thunder,"To be fair: This game has great investment in the vehicles, sounds and models. The game looks great. However, Gaijin could care less when it comes to making good maps, balanced matchmaking, good events, hiring competent/friendly PR staff... the list goes on. I'm adding my opinion to the rest of them currently in order to show Gaijin they messed up by reintroducing Chronicles, such a unfun, unbalanced mess that it was removed from future events. The current event achievements are damn near impossible for anyone who wishes to grind them out and have a life, and thats coming from someone who is on disability currently and has no life. Many things in this game steer players towards just saying ""screw it"" and opening up the wallet to be effective, right from the get go they introduce the atrocious grind, I watched a player stream his first week on this game and he barely unlocked 3 tanks playing 4 hours a day without premium and I hear it only gets worse in the later tiers.---{Graphics}---☑ Beautiful---{Gameplay}--- ☑ Good---{Audio}--- ☑ Very good---{Audience}--- ☑ Everyone---{PC Requirements}--- ☑ Decent(I get 100+ FPS on High with GTX960)---{Difficulity}--- ☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master(Controls are easy to pick up, but there are some advanced controls that you must look up or bind yourself, and controlling each vehicle and learning its pros and cons will take a LONG time, considering that you must unlock upgraded engines/transmission/rounds/etc to be fully competitive, you start off at a disadvantage. Also, matchmaking is based on the perceived effectiveness of the vehicle according to the dev, called battle rating, and not based on player skill or level, so after you get out of Tier 1 bot matches, you will be placed with veteran players that can snipe your tank at all the chokepoints because they've memorized the map and distances to the targets)---{Grind}--- ☑ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☑ Insanity(I've marked two because there are two different levels. The grind level will be insanity if you don't pay for a premium account to boost your research points. If you do so, the grind becomes about average. You will still not likely unlock things very quickly even with a premium, and even though it negates the unlocking grind for vehicle trees, Gaijin will introduce event vehicles, decals and tournaments that are insanely grindy and time based, giving players usually only a day or weekend to complete, which is hard for people with lives to manage)---{Story}--- ☑ Doesn't have any(Literally no story unless you count the ""historical"" ""campaigns"" thrown in last minute. Not worth playing, don't bother. They give you a crap reward for playing and most of them are insanely hard to do on anything but arcade mode.

868,14785,14790,Robocraft,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI was a fairly casual player, get a couple matches in and tinker with my bots for a couple hours here and there. I was even considering spending some cash when able.The original system was near perfect, you could play free and feel rewarded when you played well. Each match (solo and PvP) rewarded RP, which was the game's primary currency. You could gain RP at fairly decent rates if you played well, up to 50k a match or more, and it was used to purchase new blocks for your robot. Premium wasn't much of a game changer, double currency gain and boosted exp, along with full use of the color wheel when painting your bot.Now, after the Epic Loot update, I am very glad none of my money went to Freejam. That accomplished feeling when performing well and helping your team towards victory? It is gone, for good by the looks of it.Now, you get RNG loot crates (if you're familiar with korean MMO's.. yep.. those, minus the keys) that have a tendency to give things you don't want or need, and the only way to get what you do want/need is to recycle the unwanted parts for Robits (new currency). The tier of crate awarded is determined by how well you played as a singular entity, team play nolonger matters as long as your side wins and you did the best. Losing team all get the same low tier crate, regardless of effort.You only get Robits from recycling. Recycling might give you anywhere between 10 and 200 Robits, depending on the part and rarity (they also added rarity tiers) while the part you want will cost 20k or more. On top of that, the loot crates withhold items from free players, displaying what they could have gotten, all they needed to do to recieve these withheld parts is purchase Premium.Premium is no longer just contributing to development with the perks of fancy colors, more money, and a bonus awarded to your team. Premium is now dangled infront of your face every time you open a crate, teasing you with parts that are decidedly better than what is currently being awarded. While still giving you far less than what you actually earned with your effortsSo, after updating and seeing what the ""new"" game has to offer. I have realized that even if I bought premium every month, I would not be able to progress towards my goals at a reasonable rate.Before this update rolled out, I was just a couple thousand RP away from buying a set of mid tier legs for my new mech styled bot. After I updated, I had 244 Robits and no cashshop currency, and no compensation for said cash shop currency because it wasn't above the 100 mark (You could earn cash shop currency ingame, previously). I tried a few matches, then tried a couple solo matches, after roughly 3 hours I had earned around 100 Robits. I needed over 120,000.To think, this update was partially aimed at people like me, according to Freejam.

The PvE content is pretty good compared to other card games since it allows infinite rewards from the Gauntlet mode, it's not much (3 Silver chests at maximum wins which equals to about 700 gold + 3 uncommon cards) but you can grind that endlessly if you choose to focus on PvE which is a cool option to have and unique as well.The Draft in PvP is also a lot of fun since you will keep all the cards you pick from the draft making you choose which card you want. When starting out you probably want cards for your collection so sometimes you will pick cards that are bad for your draft but good for your collection. (I picked an off-color legendary just to have it)Overall if you are bored and want a more complex card experience without losing your head in huge wall of text cards like Magic, this is your card game. It's inbetween Magic and Elder Scrolls in terms of complexity and deck building possibility. The f2p model is generous and you will build a collection quickly if you keep playing. I haven't encountered a gold cap per day yet so I suppose it's not there unlike the other card games.

Multiple playmodes including draft, AI draft (forge), vs AI (gauntlet), and constructed, all with very generous F2P rewards. The game itself is very like Magic the Gathering with a streamlined ruleset and response windows.Certainly the game isn't for everyone, some people don't like making resources part of deck construction. I personally think it adds another dynamic, and is very fun for me. Another complaint I hear is that 75 card decks lead to less consistant gameplay. This isn't true... what it leads to is less combo oriented gameplay and less one-card build around decks. What it leads to more of is VARIETY. I have 220 hours in this game, and I'm not even beginning to get sick of the metagame. The 75-deck size is fantastic at keeping every game interesting and the meta-game from becomming dull. If all you want is to run a linear combo deck centered around 1/2 cards, Hearthstone might be more your game.

881,4001,4005,Team Fortress 2,"Ah, classic ol' Team Fortress 2. There really just is nothing like it. It has team-based combat, unlockable weapons, and most important of all... HATS! But forget about that for just a second, what makes this game so good? The humour of this game is just amazing. Every class has something nasty to say about each other, and you would know what I'm talking about if you played the game or watched the ""Meet The ..."" trailer/teaser series. It just makes me smile when I hear a line I've never heard before. Secondly, the team-based combat. As with most modern day FPS's (With the exclusion of the Battlefield series, somewhat.), you don't see a lot of team oriented gameplay. Take for example, Call of Duty. It's really just a run and gun experience, and that's not what teamwork really is about. In TF2 though, it really requires a good deck of cards for you to win. You need to work together to capture the control point, get the intelligence, push the cart, and etc. It can get rather intense, with either your team or the other team trying to do a push. That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system.With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use.The thing you've been waiting for...HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard ""Unique"" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get ""Genuine"" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole ""hat"" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.)But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before.",1, ah classic team fortress like team based combat unlockable weapons important hats forget second makes game good humour game amazing class nasty know talking played game watched meet trailer teaser series makes smile hear line heard secondly team based combat modern day fps exclusion battlefield series somewhat lot team oriented gameplay example duty run gun experience teamwork requires good deck cards win need work capture control point intelligence push cart etc intense team team trying push aspect love unlock drop system games duty need level order gain new weapons attachments current weapons need drop randomly weapon advantages disadvantages making virtually balanced way note grades overall upgrades stock weapons stock weapons effective new weapons droppable weapons stat bonuses stat drops stock weapons unlockable weapon suituational degree important plot weapon use thing waiting hats important hats add flair game customization options class result spectacular looking player look play hats somewhat complicated standard unique quality hats drop rarely unlocking crates trading genuine hats ordering game special compaign gives hat free buy game real meat hat thing holy unusual hat yes rare expensive obtain feeling satisfaction achievement time especially unbox hard try hats add special game stranges killstreak weapons track kills obvious difference stranges track lifetime kills killstreak weapons count kills got yes recommend game nice game play hours hopefully find new

Now it's gone.Last and final attempt was when Maximum Loadout update came in. I don't say it was bad, to be honest it gave a player a possibility to efficiently fight against all kind of robots.But thing that finally made me think bad about this game is RP nerf. FJ agreed it was too rough and ""fixed it"".Hah, don't make me laugh. ""you’re looking at ~140 hours for 2x MegaLegs and 6x MegaLasers"" - RP Price Reductions and Time-To-BuySo I would need to play 2,5x more hours that I played to get it.It's about 43 200 000 RP = about 52 k RP for battle. As an average player before ""fix"" I took for good TDM 150 k - 200 k RP, which wasn't much. Now for same battle I take ~15 k? For great one with most kills and damage ~25 k. At lvl 98 with 25k robot!!This is a mockery. After nerf and ""fix"" most of players still get 10% of RP what they get ealier.FJ ruined the greatest thing about this game. An abillity to build everything what you can imagine without worring about money. You are making a tank, but miss 1 SMG to finish? Here, play 2-3 hours to get it.If devs wanna keep that ""fix"", they better should do something with matchmaking.

The Vet thing provides a lare avdange when I got back. But this didn't stop me from reconizing some magor problems. Most games are land slides. Which means you straight up win or you horrible lose. Every so often you have a close game. Its very rare. Such as finding a speck in the sand type of rare. My first game had 5 Fighter/Bombers on the enemy team. If you so much had stepped outside you die. If not by planes. It was by tanks. All I have are 2 mines and 4 nades. If I go anywhere near a tank, it kills me, crew spots me, moves, is being protected, or drives while I am chasing it to but that AT mine down infront of it. I rarly find any RPGs or Panzerfaust.

Mining the entire house waited for a while, enemy tried to cap and I blew them sky high. Those momment where all in bad games. The main problem for me is credits. Money is scarce. Equiment cost a little too much. 29,500 for a wrench while I have a soviet vehicle which I constaly crash. Well It would be a good buy, if only I got it on my American tank crew man too. Also the cost to turn them into a tanker is costly. 114,000. That must be one hell of a tank I am getting if I am paying that much. Also Boculars which (Could) be useful are 25,000. RPG cost around 165,000 Which suck even more.Vet provides a advatage that kills off most Free to Plays like myself. They get 1 more equiemet slot and 1 more skill slot. This kinda sucks for me.

When I found it, I thought it was going to be one of those parts of the game where you have to do very hard things to get back points, or buy them with real money.

903,3186,3189,Ring of Elysium,"Access ReviewI rarely write reviews on Steam but this game really deserve a good review.Okay so i'm gonna write my review the way I would love someone to write it :GENERAL FEELING : That's beautiful. My graphic card is middle/low end ; and even with graphics set on low, the game is a beauty. The snow seems so real, the feeling is so smooth, thats amazing. The concept is great, not too many people in the battle royale (only 60 per game) and 4 final spots of winners (in a chopper, which is very realistic, love that).GAMEPLAY : Nice. Battle Royale without bugs, without stupid dance or crafting wood *hum hum* ; and a realistic snow-style scenario. Enough people to be worried, not enough to die instantly. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. Personnalisation is huge, aiming is fine, realistic ballistic (far ennemies ? you got to shoot a little higher due to distance), fluidity is really something that is missing for me in PUBG, and I was stunned with the fluidity of Ring of Elysium. GRAPHICS : If you cant afford Steep, here is a free version. You can snowboard in the snow, of climb a cliff, even paragliding your way to the safe zone. And it's insanely beautiful. Sometimes I stop my chase and just look around the beautiful environment. I cant even immagine what this game looks like in Extra graphics setup...COMMUNITY : Great community on Reddit and in official forums, even in game I tried to go with a team of 3 people and they were very friendly. Mute option, push to talk option, you're even ready if mr.boring is in your team.You can play it solo, still very enjoyable. You can play it duo, thats for me the best, and in a 4 group, funny but not very serious (depend on your mates). PROS AND CONS :+ Graphics : 17/20+ Free and no pay to win : 20/20+ Smooth and accurate aim : 19/20+ Realistic scenario : 18/20*+ You can choose between third person or first person game : 20/20+ Lobby/Matchmaking quickness and fairness : 16/20, sometimes it goes until 1 minute to find a game.+ A total access to our statistics (but not where we shot in someone's body etc.) 15/20- Only one map (beautiful tho) 11/20- Only one mode (But its Beta and more is coming) 13/20- So far only 60 people per game (which is nice, but a mode with 100, 250 etc. would be fun). 13/20- A Tier level style evolution, but no ""Ranking points"" and no competitive ranking. 11/20That's it, but the general conclusion is that it's a wonderful game.

911,11324,11328,Eternal Card Game,"This game would be really great except for one issue: The card cost-effect balance, especially for instant-kill cards, is very-much skewed towards the low end. This means that single use spells like Torch (1 cost, deal 3), Deathstrike (4 cost, Kill any unit), Vanquish (2 cost, kill any unit with 4 or higher attack), Treachery (2 Cost, deal 2 Damage and discard a unit of your choice), and the like... are extremely spammable, meaning that control decks are entirely too powerful, since the enemy could at any time just throw out a bunch of damage/instant-kill cards and it's game over for any deck that relies on units or stacking effects. It means that there are a whole host of game mechanics that just go out the window in the face of a control deck which hard-counters every single other strategy except Aegis-spam, and can win even then if they play tactically.And that's the problem: Control is so viable that there is only one strategy that forces it to play tactically for the win, excluding situational outliers.What would help this is if spell costs went up significantly for spells like htis. This would limit the use of such a spell in the early game and force players to  Or, perhaps, if they were balanced by effects: Deathstrike is a 4 cost spell that kills a unit, but that unit deals its attack or health in damage to you, and Vanquish kills a damaged unit with 4 or more attack.",0, game great issue card cost effect balance especially instant kill cards skewed low end means single use spells like torch cost deal deathstrike cost kill unit vanquish cost kill unit higher attack treachery cost deal damage discard unit choice like extremely spammable meaning control decks entirely powerful enemy time throw bunch damage instant kill cards game deck relies units stacking effects means host game mechanics window face control deck hard counters single strategy aegis spam win play tactically problem control viable strategy forces play tactically win excluding situational outliers help spell costs went significantly spells like htis limit use spell early game force players balanced effects deathstrike cost spell kills unit unit deals attack health damage vanquish kills damaged unit attack

918,2644,2647,War Thunder,"I wrote a review of this game earlier, and I'm going to change it to Not Recommended because I'm finally fed up with the developers.WT has its good sides. It can be big fun. I can't recommend it, however, even though it's free, because, well, I'll just list the most glaring issues.• There is next to no teamwork, partly because the maps are so open and do little to ""herd"" the players together. There also aren't really any out-of-bounds zones like in Battlefield. Also, you can't place orders, contact reports, etc. on the map like you can in Battlefield 2, or form your own squads to coordinate your other players. There is also next to no communication. There's not even VOIP.• Pacing is terrible. You can spend litterally minutes driving to the battlefield from across the map only to be sniped when you finally get there. Rinse and repeat. No forward spawn points like in Battlefield or Wargame.• Hackers. Server security is poor.• Devs release DLC after DLC, even temporary content for 1st of April, without fixing bugs and typos that have been there from the beginning. I cringe every time I see glaring mistakes like ""Player suffers damages of elevator"".The glaring bugs are ridiculous, too. I've never played a game where you can spawn in before your map has finished loading, leading to crashing into invisible friendly tanks because their graphics haven't loaded yet. Or most of your friendly vehicles disappearing from the map while you're dead, making it harder to judge the situation and deciding where to respawn. I could go on.• DLCs are way too expensive. I get that free-to-play games have to make money somehow, but charging the price of a whole game for a single vehicle is just ridiculous.• DLC is pay-to-win.• Tech tree goes from pre-WWII tech to modern tech, which is awesome; it's just a pity that 99.99% of players won't ever see modern-day tech because you have to grind your way up from 1930s tech, which takes forever without spending a fortune on unlocking vehicles early.

927,2522,2525,War Thunder,"Ah.. War Thunder Review time I guess.Let me go ahead and state, if your a fanboy, I dont care. Your opinion means nothing to me, simply because your opinion is tainted because it could be your ""favorite"" or you really ""enjoy"" this game, therefore keep it too yourself or do a review yourself.This game is not fun in the long run, compared to World of Tanks, the only thing this one has that World of Tanks doesnt, is it isnt a silly tank shooter. I dont care for the planes, simply because, I found it boring to fly around, press M1 over and over or hold it down, until finally your shots actually do something of use other then sparking on the person, or shooting the center gear leg or fuel tanks causing a fuel leak. I had tons of funs in Ground Forces though, Until you start playing every single faction there is, and start to see the reason why you see more of some factions and some of others. This game has no actual form of Balance, and in its attempt to try and keep things balance, and adding realistic stuff too it, they made some things completely unfun to play, while others are so brain dead you can just just toward people, bouncing shells off left and right as people try to pen you.Now, I enjoyed this game. I managed to get a good friend to play, he however left because the game was unfair for him, I ignored it and thought it was just him actting up. I regret not listening too him, after the whole ""cool factor"" of the game wears off, you start to see the problems. Lets start off with Gameplay first.Gameplay: Though it is fun, has a ton of problems, the game doesnt prepare you for anything, because of how the game Progresses, at first you start off as Reserves vs Reserves, which is the starting tanks. This is completely pointless to talk about, because its the most basic of the game, point and shoot, you will most likely kill anything you just shot at, or badly damage them, BUT even at this Tier, yous tart to see the real problems, Because of how the game BR system works, even though you only have 2 tanks, their both 1.0 and require a bit of knowledge to beat higher BR tanks, the game is completely fine with putting you up against these tanks, Often. This is called Uptiered, and its the most annoying thing to happen too you, at any point in the game, because you are fighting against tanks who are actaully better then yours, in any way possible, this of course only if the tank driver can use the tank, but they still get a advantage wtih either, better gun, or better armor, or faster etc etc. Im not even going to talk about Downtiered, because its just basically swinging a club at baby seals at this point. The game shooting Machinics are simple, aim at a spot on a tank, and shoot, if it pens, it hits something, if it doesnt, well it doesnt, too kill a tank in this game, you either kill all their crew, or blow up thier ammo, which requires aimming (For some tanks, ill get too that later), and this is where you start killing the Major problems of this game. Four out of the now Five factions to play Ground Forces, are easy to play. each one giving you HE filler AP rounds, made to pen the tank then blow up and kill damn near anything in the tank, these tanks are what will kill you the most often, because their the easiest to play. Russians have slopped armor with fast moving tanks, allowing even their thin armored tanks to just put themselves into a Angle and bounce shells. Germans have ""Nuke-Rounds"" even at lower tierss, alot of the German tanks, just instantly kill anything you can pentrate, Same with Americans. now Japanese and British is where alot of suffering of the game happens. British tanks Feature fast reloading gun, fast tanks, good moblity (not when backing up) and their guns are extramely good at pentrating, however since British tanks didnt field HE filler rounds in the world, they lack them in the game, actually they dont have anything (expect for the recently added Sherman 2, thats basically M4A1 Sherman put into British line), This makes British one of the most annoying factions to actually kill tanks in, Because Armor Piecing rounds, with no HE fillers is what the British used in real life, in the game.. none of the reason why the British used said rounds, are at all shown, Since you can repair your tank, This also makes it so you have to snipe every single crew or 2 crew in the tank, or try to cause a their ammo to blow up, meanwhile most of the british tanks, cant take a single shot, and will mostly die in a single hit. Japanese have very little armor on their tanks, very small pentration with their guns, and very little HE filler starting out, later on they get up too the same ground as, Americans, Germans, Russians.Now Progression in this game, is low, its a grind while playing matches to unlock a new tank... however once you unlock the tank, you have too use the tank, in order to unlock mods, IE different ammo, REPAIR KIT, or ability to put out fires, all of which shouldnt be a thing, without the repair kit, if your cannon barrel or cannon breach is broke, you cant repair it unless you go too a cap point, Fires will kill you without the ability to put them out, and its a slow and annoying death and will happen alot since you only get 2 charges of it anyway. Luckly the game is nice enough to let you repair your tracks without the repair kit.Im not even going to touch the ""Pay to get"" tanks, because the fact you can buy them and get all the mod for them, already says why their there, its just a massive money grab too get a tank, you cant unlock.All and All, No I wouldnt recommend anyone to get this game, and if you do, too never spent money on it, I have, and I regretted it.",0, ah war thunder review time guess let ahead state fanboy nt care opinion means simply opinion tainted favorite enjoy game review game fun long run compared world tanks thing world tanks nt nt silly tank shooter nt care planes simply found boring fly press hold finally shots actually use sparking person shooting center gear leg fuel tanks causing fuel leak tons funs ground forces start playing single faction start reason factions game actual form balance attempt try things balance adding realistic stuff things completely unfun play brain dead people bouncing shells left right people try pen enjoyed game managed good friend play left game unfair ignored thought actting regret listening cool factor game wears start problems lets start gameplay gameplay fun ton problems game nt prepare game progresses start reserves vs reserves starting tanks completely pointless talk basic game point shoot likely kill shot badly damage tier yous tart real problems game br system works tanks require bit knowledge beat higher br tanks game completely fine putting tanks called uptiered annoying thing happen point game fighting tanks actaully better way possible course tank driver use tank advantage wtih better gun better armor faster etc etc m going talk downtiered basically swinging club baby seals point game shooting machinics simple aim spot tank shoot pens hits nt nt kill tank game kill crew blow thier ammo requires aimming tanks ill later start killing major problems game factions play ground forces easy play giving filler ap rounds pen tank blow kill damn near tank tanks kill easiest play russians slopped armor fast moving tanks allowing thin armored tanks angle bounce shells germans nuke rounds lower tierss alot german tanks instantly kill pentrate americans japanese british alot suffering game happens british tanks feature fast reloading gun fast tanks good moblity backing guns extramely good pentrating british tanks nt field filler rounds world lack game actually nt expect recently added sherman s basically sherman british line makes british annoying factions actually kill tanks armor piecing rounds fillers british real life game reason british said rounds shown repair tank makes snipe single crew crew tank try cause ammo blow british tanks nt single shot die single hit japanese little armor tanks small pentration guns little filler starting later ground americans germans russians progression game low grind playing matches unlock new tank unlock tank use tank order unlock mods ie different ammo repair kit ability fires nt thing repair kit cannon barrel cannon breach broke nt repair cap point fires kill ability slow annoying death happen alot charges luckly game nice let repair tracks repair kit im going touch pay tanks fact buy mod says massive money grab tank nt unlock nt recommend game spent money regretted

962,1052,1055,Fractured Space,"So, I played this game back when you paid for it once and then played. It was good. The environment wasn't complex, but it had enough in it to make ship positioning interesting and strategically relevant. There were just a handful of ships to choose from, and they were distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally. The community of players was pretty fun to play with too.Now the game is 'free', but actually not. The current total cost of all DLC is $179.96. The game is not good. Jumping from one tiny box to another makes everything feel cramped, and more congested than before - flying now feels like driving in Los Angeles. Ship positioning is mostly irrelevant because there are very few long sight lines left. The ship design has gotten lazy, and it's hard to tell one conglomeration of plates and girders from another anymore. And the player community... well, read the other negative reviews (most of which are well thought out and written by experienced players) and then read the comments on them. The people who attack the writers of those reviews personally, instead of reading and responding to the criticism... that's the current player base. It's like playing with all the people you know and love from YouTube comments.The recent updates are a pretty naked cash grab, and don't make the gameplay better than it was. Pay to win and lootboxes... this sort of thing is so disgusting it should result in developers being ostracized by the game community at large. EA would probably give you a medal though. Maybe if you're hurting for money you could sell out to them?

This means that you must make a new character everytime you die.  That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing.

978,16395,16400,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"The game has an interesting idea to say the least. Its cool how you can field strip or fully take apart a gun, but for what reward? You'll eventually get to the point where you grind and grind and grind and grind untill you get the next gun. Guess what you have to do next? Yep, grind. The game holds your hand through the entirety of the game (except shooting range). For example, you cannot make mistakes, if you try and put one thing with the wrong component it does nothing. What they should've done (in my opinion) is have some sort of feed back, like show a little animation of the two parts trying to fit together and failing instead of just nothing.Now on to DLC issues, remember how I was complaining about ""grinding"" up above? Well you don't have to worry about it! Just shove your credit card into the disc tray, pay $50 and get 100+ guns half of which you won't even touch! Also ""4 Cars Pack"" and ""5 Skeletons Pack""???? Why are there cars and skeletons in a game called ""World of GUNS:  GUN  Disassesembly????? I haven't bought these (shocker) but the ideas are cool and I think if they were seperate games. The ""10 Shooting Ranges Pack"" is completely pointless. The one thing I'm not sure about is if the ""World War II Pack"" includes guns in the game right now or exclusive guns only in this pack. ""Starter Pack"" is obvious although it doesn't say what guns are included.Overall, the game is interesting and quite cool, but the way it performs, with grinding being its main problem, even though this game is free and steam makes games easy to uninstall, its still not worth it.",0, game interesting idea cool field strip fully apart gun reward eventually point grind grind grind grind untill gun guess yep grind game holds hand entirety game shooting range example mistakes try thing wrong component opinion sort feed like little animation parts trying fit failing instead dlc issues remember complaining grinding worry shove credit card disc tray pay guns half wo touch cars pack skeletons pack cars skeletons game called world guns gun disassesembly bought shocker ideas cool think seperate games shooting ranges pack completely pointless thing sure world war ii pack includes guns game right exclusive guns pack starter pack obvious guns included overall game interesting cool way performs grinding main problem game free steam makes games easy uninstall worth

I have many years experience as an MTG player and have a wide range of knowledge on card game mechanics.

This is one of the best teams I've seen on an indy game, many of them being MTG Hall of Famers. The game is relatively free to play and has many different formats to support different skill levels of players. With proper collection management, you should be able to craft a tier one decklist within your first few months of playing (I say months because I assume you are ambitious enough to attempt to craft a control deck.) Also, the integration between twitch and eternal is phenomenal, if you link your account and watch streams you will get a lot of free stuff. Now lets talk about gameplay. If you are transitioning from either HS or MTG, you will find the phases a bit odd at first. HS players won't be accustomed to interacting on the opponents turn and MTG players will be upset they don't get priority after every single action like MTG allows. But given a bit of time, you will find that the gameplay is really smooth and fair. The power level of the cards is a bit higher than MTG imo so that can take a bit to get used to as well.Their is a lot to say about this game but the wine is starting to kick in so I'm gonna leave it at this is the best CCG online. You won't find one better. I've tried.

Kudos to the graphics department, these ships look beautiful, kinda makes me feel like flying ships like Alien's Nostromo or the Sulaco (yeah, fangirling much, ain't I?). I always get pretty nervous when I see my own ship starting to spit sparks and flames and the hull seems to melt under enemy fire. As much as it feels so sweet when you see the same thing happen to enemy ships... oh the giggles when they finally pop.The maps are nice as far as I can tell after just a few hours of gameplay. Navigating between asteroids, ducking in cover behind anything that the environment offers: neat stuff! (yeah, try to ""duck for cover"" with ships that huge)Gameplay? It's FUNFUNFUN!

1004,10371,10375,theHunter Classic,"I have played this game for a about 2 years now (almost exclusively outside steam). I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.General characteristics of the game:The Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt. Downloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards.If you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun. If you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy. Pros:- There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] )- There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old) - Very nice reserves- Good graphics- Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters- It's challenging- It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it- Frequent updates- Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!)- Many great people in the community- A very active forum, where all your questions can be answeredCons:- It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time)- Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours- It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear- Very limited options for character customisationCheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter) ",1, played game years exclusively outside steam good friends community enjoyed thousands hours game general characteristics game hunter game trying find balance realistic simulator fun game fast paced time understand mechanics game play way want people focus winning competitions getting general leaderboards enjoy luring birds walking reserve tracking calling animals love hunt downloading game free limited options recieve weapon allows hunt species willing pay licenses gear hunt species like use weapons fond achievement system depends animals shoot weapons use killing animals different weapons gives hunterscore basis position leaderboards wish weapons cost lot money great bundles good weapons permission hunt species game buying licenses specific species advise buy membership packs permission shoot species certain time nice weapons gear furthermore game types current bought real money allows buy store earned missions special events buy consumables improve game special shotgun thinking buying things ingame store hesitate message steam advice buy different species typical rare colored animals found albino melanistic etc different weapons incl rifles handguns bows modern old nice good competitions compete fellow streets years enjoy frequent special events holidays special competitions store great people active forum questions bugs takes long time fixed long server times month minutes expensive want lot limited options character customisationcheers gierenhart grafzerk thehunter

No.Should you make up your own mind and try it out for yourself? Yes.Reasons I stopped playing: 75 card decks are dumb to me. Most games go into top deck mode orheavy mana flood/screw.

1010,14996,15001,Robocraft,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe first time I played this, I was confused and clueless, but I had a blast! This game is one of the most unique ones I've ever played, or ever made and highly enjoyable. The more enjoyable the game will be the more you experiment your own vehicle and the more you try to be creative. Updates always come, making the game better and better, but now... It's just a plain piece of junk... The game is getting more and more Pay-to-Win, unfriendly towards Free Players, and overall greedy! We used to be patient and try to be as skilled as possible, but now you just have to pray to get the good stuff, not to work hard for them anymore! The worst part is that they changed our choices.Back then, we could either immediately buy the cheap stuff that you think you'll one day need or save the robopoints (now ""robits"") so you could finally buy that awesome gun everyone else keeps killing you with. But now you just have to pray to get the good stuff in a crate... You're no longer working hard and rewarding yourself, instead, you'll gamble and hope to get a good item and almost never getting the one you actually want or need!Back then, we could either be Snipers providing cover for the ones fighting for the team or be an SMG tank roaming around and messing with enemies as you drain their health. There used to be class system! The game is completely balaned since us players have Strengths and Weaknesses. SMG > Planes, Snipers > Plasma Tanks, Plasma Tanks > SMG. But now, it's just a messy war with players filling their vehicles with random stuff, making it unfair for ""weaker"" robots.Back then, we could buy Galaxy cash and go Premium to get awesome cosmetics and extra robopoints are only given to Premium Players, or just work hard and not care about design. But now, Premium players could also get Crates full of hyper good things that Free Players will take forever to have and High-Teir weapons they get in a blink of an eye. Giving them unfair advantage from the Free Players! Want balance? Go Premium!Back then, we could decide whether to use Plasma Cannons that require Prediction and Timing, Rail Snipers that require Accuracy and Steadiness, SMGs that require Numbers and Speed, or Nano Disruptors that require Companionship and Judgement. They all take skill, experimentation, and practice. But now, Tesla Slicers, Ion Distorter, Proton Seeker, and Lock-on missiles? All we have to do is to charge at enemies, get closer to them, and select a target to do some damage! All you need is an instructions manual to destroy a lot of players with ease!The game's awards are used to be achievements, something for the devs to be proud and inspired of! Don't let the destruction of the game make these awards turn into advertisements to decieve players believing this game is a gem!Freejam!

1015,1480,1483,Fractured Space,"Fractured Space is a game of giant spaceships, stately and graceful motion, and ruthlessly low TTKs coupled with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30m or more. It's a remarkable example of how you can take the MOBA archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only looks totally different and plays totally different, but actually builds on the good parts of the genre.Many reviews for this game go into the strategic depth (they're right), the tactical depth (they're right) or the mechanical level of complexity (they're mostly right). The game plays well, for the most part, and can easily support thousands of hours of play. But I won't say much more on that.I would like to point out the community management for Fractured Space is top notch. The community managers know that having a CoC and banning people based of it will draw a lot of fire on Steam from trolls. But they've stuck to their guns. I have never seen CM's more proactive on banning racists, transphobes, homophobes and even misogynists! It's incredible, and you have to know it comes at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collectives of Steam.Even the game devs can get punished for bad behavior. While it's rare to see them cross the line, it has happened and the CMs have not handed out special treatment.They do this while still being tolerant of the normal outbursts and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming communities. You can disagree with a dev and call them out on it, even in game or on the forums, and they will listen. They may not AGREE with you or ACT on what you say, but for such a well-policed community the actual level of debate is ""very spirited.""That's something special and rare all on its own, and ECG deserves a lot of credit for this. It's a real accomplishment all on its own.Finally, Fractured Space's deep gameplay is not marred by monetization mechanics. In general, ECG knows that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modifications and ""boosters"" (much like any f2p game). But there is no mechanical advantage afforded as of 09/2016 from any store option. It's a fair game, with a lot of depth. You can play it knowing that while enemies may be better than you, or more coordinated than you, they still have the same tools in their toolkit as you do. And they have stuck to their guns on that stance even though it has caused a lot of short-term problems for them.",1, fractured space game giant spaceships stately graceful motion ruthlessly low ttks coupled strategic defensive play m remarkable example moba archetype starting point end looks totally different plays totally different actually builds good parts genre reviews game strategic depth right tactical depth right mechanical level complexity right game plays easily support thousands hours play wo like point community management fractured space notch community managers know having coc banning people based draw lot fire steam trolls stuck guns seen cm proactive banning racists transphobes homophobes misogynists incredible know comes cost lot ill troll collectives steam game devs punished bad behavior rare cross line happened cms handed special treatment tolerant normal outbursts rigorous debate expect competitive gaming communities disagree dev game forums listen agree act policed community actual level debate spirited special rare ecg deserves lot credit real accomplishment finally fractured space deep gameplay marred monetization mechanics general ecg knows people want unlock content collect money cosmetic modifications boosters like game mechanical advantage afforded store option fair game lot depth play knowing enemies better coordinated tools toolkit stuck guns stance caused lot short term problems

If you play for a while you get heaps of free packs and cards so you don't necessarily need to spend any money on the game. I stress how good the mechanics and lack of RNG is in this game. Yes, you do sometimes get mana screwed but that is simply part of the game. I would like to see an in-game tournament function",1, early access reviewfirst game review hours game played long time tcg player eternal great game like mechanics artwork hs mtg ygo online play heaps free packs cards necessarily need spend money game stress good mechanics lack rng game yes mana screwed simply game like game tournament function

1020,806,809,WARMODE,"Early Access ReviewI really enjoy playing this game. It's like CS:GO except you can ads (aim down sights for you newbs out there). So, if you are a CS:GO fan I think you will really enjoy this game. The maps are kinda small but have enough room to move around. I hope this game gets some more maps and some extra class stuff like med packs and different knives would be cool. It is strangely addicting and it's free so you don't have anything to lose from trying it. My rating would be a 7/10.",1, early access reviewi enjoy playing game like cs ads aim sights newbs cs fan think enjoy game maps kinda small room hope game gets maps extra class stuff like med packs different knives cool strangely addicting free lose trying rating
1021,13679,13683,Creativerse,"Early Access Review40 Hour Playtime Builder's Review(Note: Feel free to skip my backstory and head straight to the pros and cons.)As someone who put a lot of time into Minecraft a very similar game and stopped playing for a while after the project lost my interest, Creativerse did not really call to me at first. After running out of steam for my usual casual multiplayers, however, I was coaxed into giving it a go. (It was either that or Minecraft and there are only so many times one can redownload Minecraft and Optifine and get connected textures working with your desired aesthetic before you start to scream...) Regardless of my hesitancy I jumped headfirst into a surprisingly pleasant few hours. After giving myself some time to explore the world, fighting mechanics, power mining, building, and exploring all but one layer of the world I can safely say that Creativerse is a step in the right direction for the block sandbox game genre, especially where building is concerned. I'll focus on that aspect for my 40 hour playtime review, as I primarily craft and build.In addition to being a fan of building and games I am also an artist with a background in graphic design. If some of this comes across as more of an art critique or design notes, that would be why. Hope fellow builders find this review helpful!Pros:Lots of blocks to discover and craft! All blocks can be rotated. This includes furniture, lighting, etc.Unlockables. Crafted blocks are unlocked in crafting trees via discovering and crafting. No guessing the recipes either. The recipes are available in your crafting menu as long as you have unlocked that particular tree or picked up the recipe in a chest while exploring.Textures are beautifuly detailed. Seriously though, check out some of the textures on the wiki. From fancy diamond doors to subtle obsidian ore, they really gave it their all in that department. (That being said I'm not comepletely satisfied with the textures and I'll explain that in the cons section.)Biomes are very atmospheric and come with their own ambiance through the audio, visuals, and mechanics. The dripping from the cave ceiling really gives splunking that extra boost of excitement. Biomes also have their own region specific creatures of both docile and hostile varieties. Mistakes. Honestly I feel like making mistakes and experimenting with building don't put as much of a dent on your mining tools and resources as playing around in Minecraft survival does. There are no pickaxes in Creativerse. Instead you have a glove with different levels of mining cells. They can be expensive to make but they last a LOT longer.Cons:Crafting tree textures. I love the crafting trees (the system not the flora). I love that crafting a block unlocks other recipes. I do not, however, like how blocks of the same recipe class look next to each other. Wood, for example, has several block types that I would like to use together as the base of a build: wood half slabs, wood stairs, wood walls. The wood stairs are textured in a very high contrast way and are definitely in a different hue than the wood half slabs. Wood half slabs use a subtle wood floor texturing while the wood walls have VERY little texture at all. Together it looks like kind of weird mesh of textures. Like three different artists on three different projects designed them and set them side by side. Not a lot of textures look good next to each other and a lot of blocks feel over-designed/over-textured/too high in contrast? I have trouble getting particular builds to work especially when going for a rustic, nordic feel. Obsidian, to me, is the biggest letdown. I would have liked to use it as a darker metal framework for things but the block is too saturated and edging towards a dark purple instead of a more neutral feel. That said the limestone tree has some goregeous blocks and I really enjoy building with those. Half slabs. I thought half slabs in Minecraft were the bane of my existence. But surprisingly they do one simple thing that makes all the difference in the world comepared to these little buggers. Minecraft halfslabs stack on top of each other and Creativerse half slabs don't. This goes for any other block you attempt to place on a bottom-set half slab. In Creativerse, setting half slabs on the top half of the block space is super easy with the rotate function. However, not being able to put a halfslab down to fill the gap under a stair or to break up a repetative pattern in the wall is super annoying for building. They are basically only good for crafting, covering the floor, and a few decoration touches (VERY few comepared to if they stacked).What's on fire? Torches can't catch trees on fire. They can't catch wood on fire. They can't catch me on fire. But my hay roof went down in the blink of an eye. Why? The gods were as displeased about the half slab discovery on my roof as  I was, apparently.Monster spawns. Monster spawning is a bit odd in this game. I've seen rock lobsters on time out in 1x1 squares in the wall. I've seen night pigsys falling from the heavens, lighting up the night sky in their blue dying fire. Nearly every hour my friend and I have to play ""Where's the Miru?"" in our underground base because somewhere deep in the wall there is a 1x1 open space that a monster or two will spawn in a purr at us until we kill it and seal the hole.More of a note than anything, if you use too many natural blocks that have not being crafted after being mined there is a chance that monsters can spawn in that area. My friends and I learned that the hard way after dying several times behind closed doors during bathroom breaks. You have been warned.Conclusion:All in all I have had fun in creativerse so far both as a builder and as an adventurer. There are a lot of builds that I want to try in a lot of different biomes. I have a lot of hope for this game. Its in early access still and my main complaints are just things that could build this good game into a great one. If you have some time and you haven't already, give Creativerse a shot. Especially if you are someone who enjoys unlocking materials and creating. There are some bugs worth noting (which I have detailed seperatedly in the steam discussion boards for Creativerse) but I have a feeling they will be fixed in due time. Hope this was helpful to fellow imaginative minds.

1022,11205,11209,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewTL:DR - Feels like 80% Magic: the Gathering, 20% Hearthstone. It's a lot of fun. It has the deck building of Magic, with the easy UI of Hearthstone. A great mix.I tried this game after it was recommended to me by a friend. I instantly got hooked. If you enjoy this genre, it's absolutely worth checking out.It's very easy to learn all the concepts and abilities in the game, but there is enough variety and depth to the cards, that you can make any number of decks, using whatever strategy you want to try.It's also not pay-to-win. The game is very generous with free card packs, and the legendary(highest rarity) cards seem far more common than in other games. I've only been playing for a few days, and I have already opened over 10 legendary cards, and have built a top tier deck.There is a ranked mode where you take your constructed deck and battle other people, as expected.The part that I like a lot, which is unique, is that you can play vs AI and actually earn good rewards. As I was getting the hang of the game, I played in Gauntlet mode. It's a free mode(certain other modes require gold, which you earn by playing) where you face off against series of AI decks. You play until you lose, up to a maximum of 7 games, and the more you win, the better your rewards.If you want to up the ante from there, you can take the gold that you earn by playing in the Gauntlet, and enter the Forge league. In this league, you draft a deck. The game will present you with three card choices, you pick one, then you get a new set of three, rinse and repeat until you have a full deck. You battle vs increasingly difficult AI, like in the Gauntlet, but you get 2 losses and the rewards are much better than in the Gauntlet.The best part about the Forge, as opposed to say, an arena run in Hearthstone, is that you get to keep the cards that you draft. I think that's great.Go try it.

Eternal is a freaking awesome fusion of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. I always needed a new card game after MTG kept releasing such f*_king garbage computer games and Hearthstone became 100% about RNG, 100% bull$h½t decks and 0% skill.I only wish we had some more boards (but they are coming), different combat animations and some more dynamic music. Also I wish people like Kripparrian played this and I guess he would if more people played it but seeing as he makes his money doing Hearthstone videos, he plays that instead. Honestly, I'm just hoping this game stays the way that it is. It's not pay2win at all, they literally throw you free cards and free packs for just playing. The only things you absolutely have to pay for, are cosmetics that give zero benefit playing against the A.I. or other people and for a couple of very specific kinds of cards available through the long campaigns, but you can still easily buy these campaigns after a few days of gold grinding the gauntlet and playing against the A.I.Conclusion:I've spent days reading up on the meta, crafting decks and playing all the campaigns. I've played unbeatable Tavrod decks and I've gotten my butt kicked tons of times in a row. Yet unlike hearthstone when I do lose, I don't feel salty or ripped off like I do EVERY SINGLE TIME I play Hearthstone. Hearthstone either makes me hate my opponent or hate myself. I've won and lost 100s of games in Eternal and maybe only 2 or 3 times I felt cheated. As for the community, there's a little 'BM' here and there but NOTHING like what you sadly have to experience in Hearthstone.11/10. Love it or hate it, but seeing as we have no decent MTG games for PC or Console and Hearthstone has sucked for ages, I will happily take this for as long as it isn't anything like Hearthstone. 8/8 m8 keep the goodies coming.",1, early access quick review summary buy free ϟϟ ratings ϟ ϟ estimated playtime value hoursmy playtime hoursgameplay mouse value highbugs currently ea value ϟϟ impressions ϟ ϟ best thing pretty perfect fusion magic gathering hearthstoneliked card art premium card animations quick games huge information card types newbie friendly guides tips heavily rng based hearthstonedisliked play board far campaigns pretty cool narrative uncaptivatingworst thing feel like story weakest point game actual gameplay solid ϟϟ funny ϟ ϟ funny quotes game lot card mechanics pretty paragraph review easily best card game played pc eternal freaking awesome fusion magic gathering hearthstone needed new card game mtg kept releasing garbage computer games hearthstone rng decks skill wish boards coming different combat animations dynamic music wish people like kripparrian played guess people played seeing makes money hearthstone videos plays instead honestly hoping game stays way literally throw free cards free packs playing things absolutely pay cosmetics zero benefit playing people couple specific kinds cards available long campaigns easily buy campaigns days gold grinding gauntlet playing spent days reading meta crafting decks playing campaigns played unbeatable tavrod decks gotten butt kicked tons times row unlike hearthstone lose feel salty ripped like single time play hearthstone hearthstone makes hate opponent hate won lost games eternal maybe times felt cheated community little bm like sadly experience love hate seeing decent mtg games pc console hearthstone sucked ages happily long like hearthstone goodies coming

1036,8294,8298,Neverwinter,"If you like Dungeons and Dragons or fantasy RPG's and MMO's, you might want to give this a try for the first ten levels. It's kind of fun for about that long, until the payment scheme sets in and you realize how hard it's going to be to continue on improving your gear and such without spending actual money. I spent real money on Cryptic/PWE's Star Trek Online, and if you've played any of their games before this isn't anything much different in terms of paying for flash mostly. As a general rule, I don't spend much money on these games unless they really appeal to me in some way. Ironically, this game is much better than STO in all the ways you'd want and expect it to be, but in the end, I wasn't moved enough to want to spend any money on this world. The Neverwinter backdrop is there still, but it's so different from the Neverwinter I remember that it seems little more than an heir in name alone. This could be any fantasy world. I enjoyed my character's special abilities, but meh. Give it a try, you might feel differently. I can't say much about advanced game content or what you actually get after spending real cash--the difference it makes and all. No great surprises here, good or bad. Due to security concerns over PWE's failure to properly secure customer information and their failure to notice a major incursion and/or notify the public in a timely fashion, I wouldn't purchase anything from them directly. EVER. Will Steam fall? Not will, but when... but why spread your information around in more places than necessary? That's my two cents.

The story would have been enough alone to hold this game up there with the big titles at the moment if Bioware would have made it.

I give this a 4/10, only the presentation of zones and the fun combat system keep this game mildly worth playing...but I still wouldn't reccomend it.

1044,11939,11943,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewAlright.  So let's start with the negatives about the game first because there obviously are some.  The servers are still not that great, but compared to some launches, they are a lot better. (Archeage is the specific MMO that I refer too, the servers in that game were absolutely garbage for a long time.)  The optimization is also a little spotty at the moment, but this is something that will likely be fixed later.   The positives about the game.  It is fun, the combat is a little different at first and the UI can be a little overwhelming, but once you dive in and understand the game the system is actually enjoyable and makes you consider each combat decision carefully.  The race and character diversity and customization is also very deep, not going to say the deepest of any MMO, but definately in the top 10. The game itself is a pretty large world, and the tutorial quests along the way give you insight about how to move forward and progress.  Not to mention there are TONS of side quests to pick up along the main journey, and the story of the game is actually alright.  It isn't groundbreaking, but its not unbearable either.  Overall, the game is worth the pick up in my opinion.  The developers have made it clear that they are going to support the community to give everyone the experience that they are expecting, and despite the rough launch, the game is still enjoyable.  There is more content to come as well, so the game honestly has nowhere to go except forwards.",1, early access reviewalright let start negatives game obviously servers great compared launches lot better archeage specific mmo refer servers game absolutely garbage long time optimization little spotty moment likely fixed later positives game fun combat little different ui little overwhelming dive understand game system actually enjoyable makes consider combat decision carefully race character diversity customization deep going deepest mmo definately game pretty large world tutorial quests way insight forward progress mention tons quests pick main journey story game actually alright groundbreaking unbearable overall game worth pick opinion developers clear going support community experience expecting despite rough launch game enjoyable content come game honestly forwards
1045,13490,13494,Creativerse,"This is a voxel-based crafting and building game, so naturally that alone makes it similar to Minecraft. Having played (and loved) both, I can say that this game has some familiar elements to Minecraft, but overall the FEEL of the game is different. The music, visuals, and even playstyle are more vibrant and cheerful. Dare I say that it seems more... Playful?Lame puns aside, this game is definitely worth a try. I have enjoyed it completely free for over a year now, and would have likely sunk many more hours into it by this point had unrelated life issues not interfered. I fully plan on making purchases of the Pro DLC and coins for the store blocks when possible, but have spent 260+ fun and slightly addicted hours without doing so, and the main reason I want to make the purchases is to support the developers.If you enjoy being creative and shaping voxel worlds (alone or with friends), I highly recommend this game. An internet connection IS required to play, which can be both good and bad. Each 'world' exists on a server, allowing them to always be available to any of the players without the players themselves having to purchase hosting or host locally. I believe this is a large part of why there is a 'store' aspect to this game- running servers constantly and upgrading/maintaining those servers as more players join and more worlds are created is likely not cheap.To sum up, this game is simply FUN. Whether you prefer playing alone or hanging with your friends, this game is quite enjoyable. Purchases are not at all required to enjoy the game, but if you do enjoy the game (and have the money to spare), then you certainly wouldn't be wasting your money.",1, voxel based crafting building game naturally makes similar minecraft having played loved game familiar elements minecraft overall feel game different music visuals playstyle vibrant cheerful dare puns aside game definitely worth try enjoyed completely free year likely sunk hours point unrelated life issues interfered fully plan making purchases pro dlc coins store blocks possible spent fun slightly addicted hours main reason want purchases support developers enjoy creative shaping voxel worlds friends highly recommend game internet connection required play good bad world exists server allowing available players players having purchase hosting host locally believe large store aspect running servers constantly upgrading maintaining servers players join worlds created likely cheap sum game simply fun prefer playing hanging friends game enjoyable purchases required enjoy game enjoy game money spare certainly wasting money

I understand that the game's in beta, and  there's a few glitches like emo wolf's ""%100 more dps if not next to a human"" not working, but what really confuses me is that there's no resolution option. When it goes to full screen it doesn't take up your entire monitor making the quality look like utter sh*t. I think the most annoying part of this game was the tutorial wizard (literal tutorial wizard), it really shouldn't take 5 minutes for it to go away and let you explore the game yourself, instead of it staying on your screen just make it pop up whenever you find something new (which it does, but consider cutting out most of the beginning tutorial..).Try it if you want to waste a few minutes and see if you like it.

1054,16874,16879,Cuisine Royale,"Access ReviewDont waste your time, no matter how good you get at the game, no matter how much time you spend grinding to get on the leaderboard, it isnt worth it, just dont play this game. Because of how inefficient guns are in this game, skill is not required, no matter how good your aim is, nothing matters, one minute you shoot someone several times with a browning auto 5, just to have your hopes of killing them perish when they survive because of how broken the healing system is, then you turn around to someone else and get one shot at full health by the exact same gun. And dont even get me started with pans. Now for the spawning system...

1055,15580,15585,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewI wanted to give this game a go because I remember playing the browser game and having so much fun.  But this just isn't good.  People & NPCs never seem to spawn.  They just float like wisps or the souls from the Soul Eater anime they feed to their weapons.  Cut scenes take FOREVER to load, there's horrible lag even in the starting area that makes it impossible to play or really even enjoy.  I don't know if they have given up on this or what, but this has serious potential to be a game younger kids and people looking for something more simple could really enjoy.  If you're having issues with lag because servers cost too much or something, consider only using one server.  The community here isn't great to begin with in the game.

You have to have veteren membership to even have an equipment slot. And by the way, that membership can in no way be permanent. So you have to continue to give them money, or you can't play the game like you SHOULD be able too.Also, I would recomend that the developers make it so that your guns and unlocks TRANSFER between characters, but thats just me.Unless you have a stupid amount of money, or you just really like WW2 multiplayer shooters, then I wouldn't recomend this game to you 100%.It's a very solid WW2 shooter, with massive battles and epic momments that I really enjoyed. But its pay to even play status makes it seem to want to exclude many people who simply don't have the cash to have everything the game can offer.I'm okay with a bit of microtransactions, but when their everywhere, it's very hard to ignore.

1078,75,75,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,"Note: If you don't want my long winded review and wish to see the pro's/con's of this game just scroll paste my wall of text. However if you want my personal experience feel free to read.Now I have little time with this game keep that noted however i've had enough time with it to do a proper review of first impressions. This game starts off as a fun joke with a few cute jump scares, however that mood quickly turns grim. This game does not succeed with it's graphical appearance however the audio and ambience that you overhear quickly makes up for that. This game looks like it's just something some company threw together however if you go into how the monster is announced or how they introduce the new concepts via different room layouts, it quickly makes up for it's lack of looks with well polished audio as well as design. My first impressions of the game within the first 10 rooms was ""This is a joke of a game and dull already."" That was until the audio started tugging at the back of my mind and then I paused for the first time with the most creative surprise I had in a while, it was Spooky casually smiling at you through the static of the screen. The reason I mention this is that it was a well done concept that I can honestly say caught me off guard. So all these little things that stick to the back of your mind as you're going room by room pulled by curiosity leaves me to say that this game is definitely a great one. With it's design and use of just a few simple concepts it makes for a good experience. The last thing i'll mention that I liked that made it stand out from other ""horror"" games is that it right out introduces you the ""player"" as you dive into this house of horror. This makes for the fact that you directly are introduced, meaning there isn't some dull protagonist that you're hiding behind.Pros: 1:Audio/SFX is well polished and well used.2:Design is different than what i've encountered in the past as well as well thought.3:It slowly takes you deeper into the horror and leads to a climactic build up that was well done from my experience.4:Gives a nostalgic vibe with the room designs as well as environment.5:The game is Free to Play and a well done F2P game at that.Cons:1:Movement was quite odd and clunky at a few segments.2:Does not take kindly to players with a lower DPI 3:Textures were bland and reused makes for a dull expirience till the climax. However this minorly impacts the game.4:Lack of pull factors other than Spooky, and Curiosity and arguably the ambience.Mixed Factors:1:Voice acting was a double edged sword, on one hand it was cute and well presented on the other it wasn't executed properly. I personally enjoyed it, but other's could be turned away from the game with such a presentation.Overall Ratings:SFX/Audio 9/10Design 8/10Voice Acting 7/10Gameplay 6/10Character Introduction 8/10Graphic/Texture Rating 4/10Overal Rating 7.5/10(Keep in mind this is a F2P game)I know this rating doesn't make it seem like a must play game. However for it being Free and so well designed it is worth a try at the very least. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends in a heartbeat. Keep in mind though that this game immerses you via it's audio cues as well as it's climactic build up.

1092,8220,8224,Neverwinter,"This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.    Pros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.  Cons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.  You spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.Your only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.Until they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.  ============================================================I did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).The community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission ""Ghost - behind enemy lines"" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).Its not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it.",1, surprised bad pros pve game shines different queues dungeons skirmishes team people defeat outdoor mini dungeon level range foundry thousands player content updated keeps things fresh course create foundry mission community play applies previous statement cons classes balancing issues pvp people better gear rolled farm gear mildly pay win class issues pve instance played tank called lead believe tank hold aggro damage sponge case spend time running red spots tank means means generating threat hold aggro stand red block huge damage fully geared tank tank tried tank trees defensive gear dmg reduction parry high aoe reduction large hp pool things massive damage hope use aoe taunt long cooldown spam fighters recovery daily tactician wo nt need s viable spec found called cookie cutter spec stack attack power tree gives double attack power block means block dps lowered based shield remaining great threat damage healing game pretty bad imo saddens interest tanking nw failed class tanks taken time end game people ranged cc ranger control wizard control means healing aoe damage potential fix tank class able actually tank wo nt playing game create foundry mission time consuming spend little time wish foundry mission chose build multi story building limited tools lot harder needed example select object copy paste saved days work community rate foundry mission star system play community foundry good people create foundry missions appreciate long takes want example search foundry mission ghost enemy lines play foundry took weeks work means day working time building bad went foundry sort knowing people unappreciative reviews friendly comments people satisfying thoughtful people donate astral diamonds wish lot people nice community rates high hosted devs people play content enjoy makes feel like wrote novel actually author case people like makes worth

But don't get me wrong, Planetside 2 is hard. When it was released, you were shot down into a pod and were in most cases killed instantly.

People tell you where to go and you don't have to worry about it. It does have it's Cons. I got bored around BR 60 but took a break and got into it again. I have played A LOT and it's pretty embarassing. Since it has so many people and the servers are already handling so much it has client-side hit detection. Meaning instead of the server processing that damage has been taken, what happens on your screen is what happened. Content comes in kinda slow. The developers give us some gun that nobody uses instead of new abilities, vehicles, ect. You will encounter many bugs, however they are not game breaking most of the time (they tend to fix those).

It just wastes time.I like the idea of unique classes and abilities and that other classes cannot use a different class ability. Also that in order to get lengendary items, class weapons, abilities. You have to go to a forge (there are multiple forges on map) in which can end up being a bloodbath because everone will want to go to the forges to craft stuff. How do you craft stuff? You collect shards by destroying duplicates or basically every weapon, armor, abilities (dropped by other players).In other words I already love this game and only have like 48 minutes on it.

1110,10338,10342,theHunter Classic,"When I started this game, I didn't know what to expect. I started running into the grassy field in front of me, and found nothing, even after 20 minutes. I questioned this ""walking simulator"", however crouched down, and started walking much slower. A few minutes later, I heard a deer call, and being a novice, simply walked toward it ( I didn't know yet that you are equipped with a tracker that locates where the deer was)  I pulled out my rifle and scoped in to the general vicinity that I believed the deer to be. Shortly, I saw it in my sights. I took careful aim, fired, and completely missed. The deer ran away, and I didn't get a kill that hunt.All in all, I absolutely adore this game. The gorgeous wild beauty mixed with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal makes this game incredibly fun-for me at least. See, this game isn't a game where you get kills every other minute, this is a game in which up to hours of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sights. If you blow the shot, you can expect a minimum of 20-30 minutes either tracking the same animal down, or looking for a different beast all together. Another thing about this game that puts people off is the price tag. Although the game itself is F2P, you have to buy hunting licenses for all animals expect the Whitetail deer.  Furthermore, the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor (to conceal your scent from the deer's) or a tent (to start your hunt at a place which you placed your tent in previous hunts) alongside rifles, shotguns, and handguns;is to pay occasionally large sums of real money. For some, this is the ultimate turn off.

1129,4535,4539,SMITE®," Intro! Hello! Some know me as Hell, some as Claptrap, but most know me through school, but this review is for all of you!I've been playing smite since Cupid release (about 2 and a half years ago). However, and unfortunate event happened and my account was stolen, so I made the account that I play on to this day. The company backing this game at that time refunded me my gems and limited skins, as well as deleting my old account. General Info!    Smite is a MOBA that pits you as one of many gods against other gods in modes with objectives such as (towers, pheonixes, titans, etc.) Also, all of the characters in game, are based on REAL MYTHOLOGY, such as the norse, egyptians, romans, greeks, and mayans. Smite is also third-person, which is what makes MOBA players from all over gather and play this mix of third-person and MOBA. My only tip for you is that this game will make you love it, and it'll also make you want to destroy it. No matter what, even when you tell yourself you're bad, stick with it. This game, unlike most others gets better over time. Recommendations!  GOD PACK <3Its a great deal, although I'd at least wait until you're level 30 and are positive that you'll completely want it. It is a worthy investment at any price. You get all the gods that are out, and those that'll come out, all for 30$ I got it when there were only around 25 gods I think? I've never looked back.I recommend downloading Curse Voice to chat with friends, and to meet new people! I'd also recommmend to start out in arena and learn the basics of each god. Theres also this neat feature inside the game called VGS, its basically call outs that you'd make in chat rooms such as: [VVGH] Hi! [VSAA] I'll attack! and so forth. My personal favorite god is Hel (look at my name), she is the goddess of the underworld! Each character, like other games has jokes, and taunts. One of her ""jokes"" includes:(light side) ""I know! We should make cookies!""(dark side) ""COOKIES!? WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?Now of course, not every god talks about making cookies and beating the living ""hell"" out of each other. But please. without further ado, go out, and slam your own cookies in the battleground of the god, we're all waiting for you!If you want to sign up for an account for the game, please use my refferal link below!

1130,9335,9339,PlanetSide 2,"Frankly, you'd have to be in a coma to not want to try the game, seeing as it's totally free of charge. Regardless of your first impressions from reviews, give it a whirl!As you probably already know, Planetside 2 is all about fighting in huge battles with dozens (or hundreds) of players simultaneously in a persistent world composed of three/four 'continents' which are roughly 8 x 8 KM large; Indar (Semiarid desert), Esamir (Frozen tundra) Amerish (Lush mountain range) and in the coming summer, Hossin (Overgrown swamp). You can take control of a soldier from the totalitarian Terran Republic (TR), who rely heavily on conventional weapons with high rates of fire and quick vehicles covered with a red/black color scheme. In addition, there are the New Conglomerate (NC) freedom fighters who rely on high-recoil gauss weapons and slower-moving gameplay, all saturated with blue/gold paint. Then there is the Vanu Sovereignty (VS), who have purple and teal alien energy weapons and a variety of special traits over the other two. The battles the three factions fight across the continents are a ton of fun, with the largest battles claiming the lives of dozens of players in a few seconds, with the battles themselves lasting hours or, rarely, days. The game's lighting (which is UNBELIEVABLY good; take a look at the night sky when players are shooting flak at aircraft) makes the fights visually spectactular, with huge explosions and tracer rounds making even smaller fights hard to miss. The sounds are also extremely good, with the thundering of war and explosions, with the 'whirr' of bullets flying past your head providing unmatched immersion in an FPS.The game has five basic infantry classes; the Combat Medic, who does what you think he does. The Engineer, who sets up turrets, supplies ammo and repairs things. Infiltrators, who can hack enemy terminals and equipment, lay mines, and cloak. Heavy Assaults, who blow up fortifications and vehicles with HMG's and rocket launchers and have resist shields. Finally, there is the Light Assault, who has a jetpack and annoys people. In addition to the above, there is also a set of powered battle armour called the 'MAX' suit that players can equip that enables them to trash enemies of all kinds... for a price.Those infantry can use a large selection of cross-faction and faction-specific vehicles, like the air superiority fighters, main battle tanks and IFV's, which keep the battles mobile and dangerous. They're also a lot of fun to use, for obvious reasons (Ever run over a 20-strong platoon of soldiers in a tank? I have)Not everything is peachy, however, though nothing is 'bad':The size of the game and other technical hurdles leaves it unable to support higher-quality textures on-par with today's gold-standard, with its graphics being roughly equivalent to 2011's 'best', although the art style offsets this somewhat.The game's historically poor performance and optimization has been more-or-less fixed, but the game is still somewhat taxing on older computers. If your rig is older than, say, three years, you'll have to fiddle with some settings.There are some balancing issues with faction-specific vehicles and weapons, but most are relatively minor and the few that aren't (weren't) have been patched.The current 'metagame' (i.e. a sense of accomplishment and permanence to your actions) is rather lacking at the moment, with the continents swinging wildly from 90% VS control, to 80% NC, to 70% TR... Very little territory in the game stays with your faction for more than a few days. This should be fixed when Hossin is released, when they will release 'continent lattices' which will enable teams to totally conquer the game world.'Certifications', the in-game currency you earn by getting experience points, are somewhat slow to accumulate, so if you're planning on getting good gear several hours of gameplay is the minimum requirement. You also cannot purchase in-game cosmetic items with certs, you must buy them with real money.Other, even more minor things are present, but none, not even the ones I described, are really a hinderance by any stretch. The game is an absolute joy to play, even if you don't put any money into it, and it offers an expeience you can't get anywhere else. I award this game a great 8/10; a definite download for fans of the FPS genre.:D ",1, frankly coma want try game seeing totally free charge regardless impressions reviews probably know planetside fighting huge battles dozens hundreds players simultaneously persistent world composed continents roughly x km large indar semiarid desert esamir frozen tundra amerish lush mountain range coming summer hossin overgrown swamp control soldier totalitarian terran republic tr rely heavily conventional weapons high rates fire quick vehicles covered red black color scheme addition new conglomerate nc freedom fighters rely high recoil gauss weapons slower moving gameplay saturated blue gold paint vanu sovereignty vs purple teal alien energy weapons variety special traits battles factions fight continents ton fun largest battles claiming lives dozens players seconds battles lasting hours rarely days game lighting unbelievably good look night sky players shooting flak aircraft makes fights visually spectactular huge explosions tracer rounds making smaller fights hard miss sounds extremely good thundering war explosions whirr bullets flying past head providing unmatched immersion game basic infantry classes combat medic think engineer sets turrets supplies ammo repairs things infiltrators hack enemy terminals equipment lay mines cloak heavy assaults blow fortifications vehicles hmg rocket launchers resist shields finally light assault jetpack annoys people addition set powered battle armour called max suit players equip enables trash enemies kinds price infantry use large selection cross faction faction specific vehicles like air superiority fighters main battle tanks ifv battles mobile dangerous lot fun use obvious reasons run strong platoon soldiers tank peachy size game technical hurdles leaves unable support higher quality textures par today gold standard graphics roughly equivalent best art style offsets somewhat game historically poor performance optimization fixed game somewhat taxing older computers rig older years fiddle settings balancing issues faction specific vehicles weapons relatively minor patched current metagame sense accomplishment permanence actions lacking moment continents swinging wildly vs control nc tr little territory game stays faction days fixed hossin released release continent lattices enable teams totally conquer game world game currency earn getting experience points somewhat slow accumulate planning getting good gear hours gameplay minimum requirement purchase game cosmetic items certs buy real money minor things present ones described hinderance stretch game absolute joy play money offers expeience award game great definite download fans fps

1132,13191,13195,Fallout Shelter,"Fallout Shelter is a click game simulator where you are the controller of a Vault-Tec Vault. At the start of the game, you are randomly assigned a number from 000 to 999. The number you receive will the vault ID and will determine the attributes of your Vault, similar to the lore in Fallout.The goal of the game is to grow your vault and keep your population happy. To grow your population, you need to increase the space in the vault, grow more living quarters and feed them. You feed your dwellers and keep them happy by maintaining Food, Water and Power supplies. To maintain the supplies, you need to build Diners, Water Generators and Power Generators, man them and click on them to collect the resources (just like Farmville). As your population grows, you can unlock other facilities such as the Storage Room, Medbay, Science Lab, Overseer's Office, Radio Studio, Weapon Workshop, Weight Room, Athletics Room, Armory, Classroom, Outfit Workshop, Fitness Room, Lounge Theme Workshop, Game Room, Barbershop, Nuclear Reactor, Garden, Water Purification, Nuka Cola Bottler. As you complete objectives, the game will reward you with lunchboxes which is basically a bundle of Caps, Item Cards and other equipment.Conclusion, it's just another P2W click simulator. Best price is $150 for 1000 Nuka Cola. You can safely ignore Fallout Shelter without missing out on anything.Note: I am surprised that Bethesda Games would fall prey to the P2W business model. PROS1.

1137,12614,12618,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"Because of Assetto Corsa, I was very optimistic about indie racing simulators, and this game was free, so I thought I'd try it out.  It turns out, it's merely a freemium game, with full-on microtransactions, and you can't do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money. It's essentially the Real Racing 3 of computers, except Real Racing 3 allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent.Let's talk about the game itself. The physics kinda work, but the car feels slippery, much like a bar of soap, and the graphics are representative of a phone game-no, not even, Real Racing 3 looks much better. Especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best.Is it a bad game? Not necessarily, I'm guessing the game is merely developing, but I feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state. Definitely get Assetto Corsa instead, it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this pay-to-have-fun affair. Or, if you're broke and need a free racing game, I'd recommend Trackmania Nations Forever, which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer, or even the demo of GRID 2, which has online multiplayer.",0, assetto corsa optimistic indie racing simulators game free thought try turns merely freemium game microtransactions game practice track car paying money essentially real racing computers real racing allows progress game microtransactions offers paying cent let talk game physics kinda work car feels slippery like bar soap graphics representative phone game real racing looks better especially interior view car messy poorly textured best bad game necessarily guessing game merely developing feel worth playing let spending money state definitely assetto corsa instead looks great alpha state looks like developers care pay fun affair broke need free racing game recommend trackmania nations forever course creators frantic online multiplayer demo grid online multiplayer

1151,1593,1596,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI was about to give this a negative review because I thought it had no servers, thankfully I didn't write that review and decided to give this game another go. I got addicated to this game after my second chance: got to rank 7 in a day, and the servers were not at all empty, it just takes a while for it to find the servers near you.Now, as for the actual gameplay, I'll list cons and pros:PROS:- The visual graphics are great for a free to play game.- Not a ""pay to win"" game. You can purchase custom skins/paint jobs for your ship, and 2 ""premium ships"" is what you can buy. The 2 premium ships aren't that overpowering. To put that into perspective of how weak they are, my free ship that I earned with credits, can kill both of them in a 2v1 against me.- The sound effects are pretty real... if ships were a thing in space, I'd say the sounds would be pretty close.- You can ""upgrade"" your current ship. CONS:- Only one gamemode (to be fair, it has another gamemode, but no one is able to select it, so I think they may be working on that other gamemode).- No customizablity with the ships, other than the skins you have to buy with real money.

1157,3169,3172,War Thunder,"I highly recommend this game to new players who are curious if the game is truly good or not. Honestly, if you are reading this review, I highly recommend it. HOWEVER! -Yes this game has its ups and downs.- If you are a casual player and don't like to go high tier, stay on Arcade.-If you are a competitive player and highly tactical, Realistic and Sim is for you.-Do not believe what people are telling you, and that is ""War Thunder is too Grindy"" and ""This game is pay to win.""1: Gaijin made the prices expensive for a good reason. And that reason is not just to help themself, but also stop you from paying your way into high tier. (Unless you wanna be a complete lunatic and pay over $900 USD to get up to tier 5 per branch [I.E Army, Navy, Airforce] and higher in the future [which will be Modern Day Vehicles that's coming soon after Naval]2: Never expect things from War Thunder other than entertainment and having fun.3: If you love History, Alternate History, Military Simulation, regardless what nation you are from (I.E Russia, Italy, Germany, Japan, United States, Canada, ect.) This game is for you. Are you a weapons geek? A Vehicle expert? This game is somewhat for you. (Considering Gaijin needs to fix things here and there. Which they are.) 4: Stay away from the idea of National Bias (I.E Russian Bias, Japanese Bias, ect.)5: Watch out for people who judge your playstyle. Players in War Thunder (Some that I have seen, not all!) become very toxic (to foreigners meaning they are horrible in terms of attitude, ect.) If you think this review is good do what you wanna do. Other than that, have fun, and good luck out there players! If you have any questions let me know!ゲームが本当に良いかどうか不思議な新しいプレーヤーにこのゲームを強く勧めます。正直なところ、あなたがこのレビューを読んでいるなら、私はそれを強く勧めます。しかしながら！ - このゲームには起伏があります。 - あなたがカジュアルプレイヤーであり、上位に行くのが好きでない場合は、アーケードにいてください。あなたが競争の激しいプレイヤーで高度に戦術的なのなら、現実主義とシムはあなたのためです。 - 人々があなたに語っていることを信じてはいけません。それは、「戦争雷はあまりにも研ぎ澄まされています」と「このゲームは勝つために支払われます」です。1：ガイジンは正当な理由で価格を高価にしました。そして、その理由は自分自身を助けるだけでなく、あなたが高い層にあなたの道を払うのをやめることです。 （あなたが完全な狂人になり、将来的には海軍の直後に現代自動車になるためには、支店ごとにティア5まで上昇するために900ドル以上を支払う必要がない限り）2：エンターテインメント以外の戦争雷からのものを期待してはいけません。3：あなたがいる国（I.Eロシア、イタリア、ドイツ、日本、アメリカ、カナダなど）に関係なく、あなたが歴史、代替歴史、軍事シミュレーションを愛するなら、このゲームはあなたのためです。あなたは武器のオタクですか？車両の専門家？このゲームはややあなたのためのものです。 （ガイジンはここで何かを修正する必要があると考えています。4：ナショナル・バイアス（I.Eロシア・バイアス、日本のバイアスなど）の考え方を離れて5：あなたのプレイスタイルを判断する人々に注意してください。War Thunderのプレイヤー（私が見たことのあるものではなく、すべてではありません！）は非常に毒性になります（外国人にとって、彼らは態度などで恐ろしいことを意味します）。このレビューが良いと思うなら、あなたがしたいことをやりなさい。それ以外にも、楽しい時間を過ごしてください！ご質問がありましたらお知らせください！Ich empfehle dieses Spiel für neue Spieler, die neugierig sind, wenn das Spiel wirklich gut ist oder nicht.

Und dieser Grund ist nicht nur, um sich selbst zu helfen, sondern auch Sie davon abzuhalten, Ihren Weg in High-Tier zu bezahlen. (Es sei denn, du willst ein vollständiger Verrückter sein und über $ 900 USD bezahlen, um bis zu Stufe 5 pro Zweig [I.E Armee, Marine, Luftwaffe] und höher in der Zukunft aufzustehen, was bald nach dem Naval kommt,2: Erlaube niemals die Dinge aus dem Krieg Donner anders als Unterhaltung und Spaß haben.3: Wenn Sie Geschichte, Alternativgeschichte, Militärsimulation, unabhängig davon, welche Nation Sie sind (IE Russland, Italien, Deutschland, Japan, Vereinigte Staaten, Kanada, ect.) Dieses Spiel ist für Sie. Bist du ein Waffen-Aussenseiter? Ein Fahrzeug-Experte? Dieses Spiel ist etwas für dich. (In Anbetracht dessen, dass Gaijin die Dinge hier und da reparieren muss, was sie sind.)4: Bleiben Sie weg von der Idee von National Bias (I.E Russian Bias, Japanese Bias, ect.)5: Achten Sie auf Leute, die Ihren Spielstil beurteilen.Spieler im Kriegs-Donner (einige, die ich gesehen habe, nicht alle!) Werden sehr giftig (für Ausländer bedeutet, dass sie schrecklich in der Haltung sind, ect.)Wenn du denkst, dass diese Bewertung gut ist, was du tun möchtest.

E questa ragione non è solo per aiutarli, ma anche impedirti di pagare la tua strada in alto livello. (A meno che non si desideri essere un completo impazzito e pagare più di $ 900 USD per arrivare al livello 5 per ogni ramo [I.

Questo gioco è per te. Sei un geek di armi? Un esperto del veicolo? Questo gioco è un po 'per te.

1161,2160,2163,Path of Exile,"Pretty standard game of that genre.You can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. What i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. You have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.Sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.The (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. Microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. But pricings of around 40 bucks for an armour set, around 10 bucks for headgears or currently up to 80 bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.Also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.All in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. It simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while.

Except a few things.It's a pain in the ... knee to get enough money to be able to buy a new / better tank. I understand that it's important to see the differences between the vehicle but seriously. When I started to grind the money for the Tiger2 I had about 100.000. Tried to use the E Tigers as it was better with a higher rank tank because of the higher rewards. BUT. I was losing money constantly because somehow my tanks are like papertanks. 1 shot. ALL of them or any of them. Yes, i know with the correct location any tanks can be destroyed. Yes. But not from like 1km away. Seriously.The other problem is the players. If someone is a bit... how to say nicely, mentally challenged he can kill you. Yes even in arcade. A small push on the riverside, a small push to the line of fire. You can't do anything. And the report system. Choose teamkill, then: Explain what happened. TEAMKILL FFS!!!!On the other hand. The game is amazing looking, sounds amazing. I really like it but if you plan to get any Higher tier tanks... Be prepared. It's a russian game - there is no problem with it - but the russian tanks / planes (in the same tier) always better. Yes. ALWAYS. When I was playing in the last few months I just played for fun. T2 is the best. You can have real fun there. The higher ranks... No. It's just painful.They've told that there will be ships... Aham. We wait for ships for years now... I have time.

1173,4334,4338,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"I have over a thousand hours logged on the android version, and have sunk a couple of hundred bucks into the game; so let me be frank.This is one of the only thing Konami has done in the past 5 years that wasn't an utter disaster. Duel links is a truly good iteration of the original Yu-gi-oh series; The format has been compressed and stream lined, such as a 30 card deck limi, three spaces for monster and trap cards, the removal of phases; but it works, and it works really well.  Most of your favorite cards are there, with more being added monthly to bi-monthly, and you can use all of your old strategies to really unleash a serious beat down on your opponents. Even though it's Konami, the game isn't money hungry either. Gems are used to buy card packs, but they come in an ABUNDANCE. Free events, all the time; give aways that require you to do nothing, log in bonuses, rank up bonuses. You don't have to spend a cent to get ahead.Likely though, you will. I don't know what sort of devil magic Konami used to polish this as much as it is, but it worked. I wanted to drop money to support the game, to open new card packs and get excited when I pulled Ultra and super rares. I wanted to drop ""Just five more dollars"" on the promotinal 5 for 10 + SR Packs.The last thing I want to talk about is Ranked- It works really, really well. You will find matches near instantly, with little down time. Unless the opponent tries to stall, turns move quickly, too- and with the inclusion of the stall busting timer, they can't indefinately lock you in until you quit, otherwise they'll take an automatic loss. It's never a problem for players who take a little extra time to think of a strategy though, so worry not. All in all, this might be a better title than some of the console iterations- They've recently added a GX section- though it's completely seperate from the original world, which means going forward, even if they add new series to the game, it isn't going to impact the series you enjoy playing. You won't have to contest with Synchro monsters when they're introduced using your OG yugioh cards. In this sense, it makes every battle feel equal, you dont feel like your cards are going to become obsolete.   It's a must try if you're a Yu-gi-oh fan. Even if you're not, but you have a casual interest in the card game via nostalgia or curiosity, it's worth your time to check out, most definately.",1, thousand hours logged android version sunk couple bucks game let frank thing konami past years utter disaster duel links truly good iteration original yu gi oh series format compressed stream lined card deck limi spaces monster trap cards removal phases works works favorite cards added monthly bi monthly use old strategies unleash beat opponents konami game money hungry gems buy card packs come abundance free events time aways require log bonuses rank bonuses spend cent ahead likely know sort devil magic konami polish worked wanted drop money support game open new card packs excited pulled ultra super rares wanted drop dollars promotinal sr packs thing want talk works find matches near instantly little time opponent tries stall turns quickly inclusion stall busting timer indefinately lock quit automatic loss problem players little extra time think strategy worry better title console recently added gx completely seperate original world means going forward add new series game going impact series enjoy playing wo contest synchro monsters introduced og yugioh cards sense makes battle feel equal nt feel like cards going obsolete try yu gi oh fan casual interest card game nostalgia curiosity worth time check definately

1175,12095,12099,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewIll try to not regurgitate.  I plan on playing this for awhile despite the negative review, hoping that it gets better somewhat.  I would say that this game isn't on the level of other available MMO's even with all of its performance issues resolved however.Performance:  - This is a bad release, maybe the worse I've seen on a release.  I would like to add to the already abundant complaints on this that I believe most of these could be positive reviews or at least delayed until people reached late game if the performance issues were not as bad as they currently are.  I think it would be worth checking out recent reviews later if the studio actually invests the effort in fixing this issue.Quality of Life:  - You cant trade between your own characters, even premium currency is bound to a single character, which is stuck on a character that I was going to switch off.  - The UI is clean but not very customizable.  - Mouse binds are not a thing.Financial Concerns:  - A costume is 2600 Lumena, which is a little more that $20 USD.  You can almost get 1 lumina from a low level dungeon run, which means if you ran a low level dungeon 2600 times you could get a costume that way.  You can also get a couple 1-3 lumina from killing players.    - Almost nothing is bound to account, meaning you might have to make purchases multiple time compared to other MMO's.  - I don't know how this game will make money.  The cash shop is over-priced incouraging players to stay away from it.  Theres no subscription.  Poor reviews will drive down sales.  - I've purchased Lumena from the game that I have never recieved.  Money into the ether.Poor customization  - The skill tree has some very easy decisions where it would be foolish to go the other way.  - Chaining abilites aren't nice, it limits what you can do.  When compared to WoW where you might have a skill rotation that is optimal, this makes it bread and butter by force, and makes skill availability in PVP a thing of luck sometimes.  It demands static rotations in dynamic situations.",0, early access reviewill try regurgitate plan playing awhile despite negative review hoping gets better somewhat game level available mmo performance issues resolved performance bad release maybe worse seen release like add abundant complaints believe positive reviews delayed people reached late game performance issues bad currently think worth checking recent reviews later studio actually invests effort fixing issue quality life nt trade characters premium currency bound single character stuck character going switch ui clean customizable mouse binds thing financial concerns costume lumena little usd lumina low level dungeon run means ran low level dungeon times costume way couple lumina killing players bound account meaning purchases multiple time compared mmo know game money cash shop priced incouraging players stay away s subscription poor reviews drive sales purchased lumena game recieved money ether poor customization skill tree easy decisions foolish way chaining abilites nice limits compared wow skill rotation optimal makes bread butter force makes skill availability pvp thing luck demands static rotations dynamic situations

The devs add stuff so often that there is almost no point of complaining about some things as they might get patched soon or replaced entirely. So while I would like to say that this is a review about how the game will work and look like it is not true. In reality it will still get more stuff added and changed. The community in it is hit or miss. You can find awesome people but also salty and toxic ones. Luckily, unlike in MMOs, the interaction with them is totally optional. There is actually a self-found option where you do not even trade with people. There are walls of texts in standard chat so don't expect talking to anyone there. But trading is easier here. Non-league Hardcore trading is almost non-existent but you get to have conversations on chat and interact with people more. Leagues (either standard or HC) are the most alive content and have good trading but are limited to 3 months. So choose whatever mode you like the best. This game reminds me a lot about my Diablo 2 loot addiction. Just one more run...okay, one more...10 hours later! The newer expansion ditched the three difficulties in favour of a grand 10-act campaign and I love them for it. While the difficulties were interesting they became more and more annoying as you had better equipment or more currency. Then they just hindered you from reaching end game. This way you don't get bored by the same content (although they do recycle some stuff in Acts 6-10) and progress is fluid. End game currently is the Atlas, a vast map of interconnected levels and a mega-boss at the end. Here and in the campaign itself the bosses range from easy to WTF-just-killed-me-in-one-shot so it is always good to have a portal ready. This game is one of the best action RPGs and definitely the best free-to-play game on the market! I already spent some money on it but after 750+ hours it was just to support these awesome developers. Check it out for free yourself, the mechanics are best experienced in the game and a ton of info is explained in the PoE wiki.

1208,15052,15057,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewLets face it, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It started as neat game with cool game mechanics and lots of potential with the currency sytems. But now it is a full on pay to win.   Lets start by discussing the currency system I mentioned previously. This currency system allows players to either farm currency or, pay for it. It had good potential for the unpatient players, but then, the unpaid currency rose dramaticly. The prices went from a couple hundred to a couple thousand for the unpaid currency. And no increase in player income, unless they purchase premium. However, the paid curency droped in prices. Costing hundreds and sometimes even just 25!   Before I get too negative on the game the mechanics are flawlessly done, paying attention to details such as wait balance and manuverability (can't spell). It takes the player into a whole new relm of thinking. They actualy have to pay attention to the physics of the game. Wow! Instead of just mindlessly slaping parts together you have to think about how it will perform in battle. For example, I can't just strap 100 cannons on my rig as it would be to large and heavy. I have to think do I really want a tank or a balanced vehicle. This mechanic aslo gives a bit more freedom to the player.   The graphics are what you would expect for a free to play game, decent, and can run on any machine. Although I can't really judge those as a have a patatoe for a PC.    All in all, this game had so much potential but coulden't execute it with it's cheesy pay to win and funding. It failed to complete it's goal. Unless it was make money and  I had somewhat of a time but the pay to win players dominate the Free to play players. And it becomes a mess of losing streaks.

(where they took a heavy hitting slow firing gun and cranked the fire rate up to 11) why doesnt germany have an automatic rifle? the MG-30 exists. the panzershreck stops being useful after 150M. the bazooka on the other hand has near infinite practical effectivness if you look at their respective charts. why WOULD the bazooka be more effective than a panzershreck? the PZS had a larger round. why do the russians start off with a 70 round smg? WHY DOES GERMANY START OFF WITH A 20 RD SMG? 32 rd mags were made available for the mp34 during ww2, but i guess that kind of upgrade only counts if you are american. the AVS-36 only had 34,500 (MAX) rifles produced, why is it in the game? why does russia need another automatic gun when they have SMGs that hold 70 rds? why does a DP-27 not puncture armor, but when you put it in a T38 light tank it melts through armor like a .50cal? its a .30 cal round and its not EVEN 30-06. why are all of the planes in this game flying tanks? the firepower that most planes in this game are able to take should rip straight through them like a laser through paper mache.AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, CAN WE GET ANTI AIR GUNS THAT COUNTER PLANES?! THAT THING THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO DO?!?!all of this doesnt even mention the bugs this game has, like how barbed wire can juggle you so you cant move, how your parachute wont open for no reason, para planes randomly crashing into the ground. the bodies that randomly fall out of the sky. 2 ton cars flipping upside down from going over train tracks slowly. at this point having sunk several hundred hours into this game, i know it as ""the bad game"" and for some reason keep playing only to make more money and buy more stuff. that part is fun, PLAYING for the most part, is NOT and the game will give you more money to ride a bike in a field, than to play because of upkeep. dont buy gold, the devs dont deserve the money until they fix their mess.",0, game thing balance horrible german bias blatantly evident devs carbine game rediculously uncommon american carbines use rd mags instead infinitely common nt german aa gun damage thing mm christ sake johnson automatic rifles exist game built add americans johnson took bull americans boosted stats took heavy hitting slow firing gun cranked fire rate nt germany automatic rifle exists panzershreck stops useful bazooka hand near infinite practical effectivness look respective charts bazooka effective panzershreck pzs larger round russians start round smg germany start rd smg rd mags available guess kind upgrade counts american max rifles produced game russia need automatic gun smgs hold rds puncture armor light tank melts armor like cal round planes game flying tanks firepower planes game able rip straight like laser paper mache love god anti air guns counter planes thing designed nt mention bugs game like barbed wire juggle nt parachute wo nt open reason para planes randomly crashing ground bodies randomly fall sky ton cars flipping upside going train tracks slowly point having sunk hours game know bad game reason playing money buy stuff fun playing game money ride bike field play upkeep nt buy gold devs nt deserve money fix mess

1223,15101,15106,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewFreeJam ♥♥♥♥ed up a perfectly good game.1 year ago, this game was great. The game was based on a tier progression system, depending on your robot's ranking which was decided upon the blocks used to build the robot. Starting from tier 1, to 10. That system is now long gone for more than a year. What came after that was CPU matchmaking. Based on CPU consumption on your robot, you would be put with stronger enemies. So that ♥♥♥♥ed up the game. And guess what they did after that. Yeah. You guessed it. They ♥♥♥♥ed it up even more. How? The currency used in the game called RP (along with GC, premium currency) were both eradicated. Instead came a lousy universal currency called Robits. So how do you get Robits? You don't. Before, you would earn credits based on your game performance, good games could earn you lots of RP, which were then turned into Robits (divided by 10 or 100 or 1000) after the update. If you didn't have much RP before the update, the game simply would laugh at you in the future. So guess what they did. They introduced a loot system. Instead of spending your hard earned money how you want to, now, based on game performance, you get crates which reveal loot (NOT money) which can mostly be♥♥♥♥♥♥because you need to be extremely lucky to get something rare, so do get something rare you need to sell items so that you can get robits but selling items for robits gives something like 50-1000 robits so in each game unless you get a Platinum chest you get 50-1000 robits and rare items can cost up to 150,000 robits! WHAT?! DO THEY REALLY THINK THAT'S GOOD?

1227,13032,13036,Fallout Shelter,"Fun game, I wouldn't exactly call it free because you can get and do so much more if you spend money on this game, unlock special characters, pets, weapons, the works. And it will also benefit you more, it can become hard to make a decent amount of caps to upgrade and build new rooms. I love that you can have pets, but once again, if you don't spend a certain amount of money, don't get too excited when it comes to having a nice collection of pets. The dwellers are easy to gather as you can impregnate female dwellers with male dwellers, this will require more food and if you have a large base, your energy will run out very quickly unless you play every 5 minutes. It is also extremely hard to get lunch boxes, but very easy to send a dweller to the wasteland to get more weapons and outfits. I like the game, I just wish they would make it easier to get more caps and lunch boxes. Perhaps throw in a pet carrier when you log in every day for a whole week, or so.

1228,16613,16618,Bloons TD Battles,"Product received for freeNow, I love BTD Battles to death, don't get me wrong. I've played Flash and Mobile/Win 10/Steam (they play just the same) quite a bit. But there are a few things that really need to be fixed in this version that the devs know about (unless they live under a rock or something) but won't fix. Let's get to pros and cons, shall we?Pros:-Replayability, for obvious reasons-Good for all ages and skill levels with its family-friendliness and its battle arena system-Many fun gamemodes-A very nice tower selection-Solid graphics, most other TD games tend to be too realistic or absolutely terrible looking, this game finds the sweet spot between them-Decent matchmakingCons:-Game balance-""Downloading Vital Data"" bug-Need to pay to enjoy the game to its fullest (I'll overlook this myself due to my love for BTD, but for others this can be a huge annoyance)The pros speak for themselves, so I'll talk about my cons.Fist of all, the ""Downloading Vital Data"" bug. This bug causes you to be completely unable to play the game due to the loading screen getting stuck at ""Downloading Vital Data"" forever, and happens seemingly at random (and not to everybody), sometimes staying for days and other times requiring a simple close-and-reopen to fix. This has been around for a long, long time, and makes this game very difficult to play on PC for some people. I haven't heard of it happening on Mobile.Secondly, game balance. Many will disagree with me here, but I just feel like some towers are absolutely ****ing useless and others are winning the ""best tower"" race by a few thousand miles. Here's some examples:Dart Monkey - cheap, extremely good early and mid-game, requires zero support until round 22Spike Factory - slow, not that good at any point in the game compared to other towers, requires a lot of supportBanana Farm - gives a massive head start on economy, can be sold to defend a rush, counterrush, or rush, usable on all but one map to its fullest extentBloonchipper - combos well with many other towers, can destroy entire Ceramic bloon layers with just 2 upgrades and entire ZOMG layers with 4, and can almost infinitely stall any amount of bloons with a large enough amount of x-4 Bloonchippers (just fix this already ****it, it's not hard)These are just 4 examples. There are many, many more.There are only really 4 mid-tier towers, which are the Ninja Monkey, Monkey Apprentice, Sniper Monkey and Ice Tower. They perform well, but need support from other towers, just not too much. They're examples of very well balanced towers. Other towers are either quite a bit better or quite a bit worse, and it makes it so that higher levels of play boil down to one or two different strategies, with the rest being unable to keep up with the best of the best.Paying for faster-regenerating battle energy (battle energy being a huge part of the game) and more battle energy is already showing a little bit of pay-to-win. You can still beat energy-buyers, don't get me wrong, it isn't like buying a $1 in-game money tower that has infinite ZOMG and bloon popping power. It's still a bit of an unfair advantage. There's also the fact that you can only enter 1 club room every 24 hours without the $6 pass, and the fact that you can fully upgrade a tower for $6, making it somewhat unfair to new players who get matched up with you because of your 5/2 win-loss record. I'm not saying this game is pay-to-win, but when you need to pay to get the full experience, it's not good.Overall, I have to give this game a negative. If they put a little more thought into game balance and micro-transactions, I would definitely change my mind. Heck, even just nerfing the Dart Monkey and Supa-Vac would make an absolutely massive difference. But as it stands, this game's downsides, despite there being few, make this game quite a chore at points.",0, product received freenow love btd battles death wrong played flash mobile win steam play bit things need fixed version devs know live rock wo fix let pros cons shall obvious reasons good ages skill levels family friendliness battle arena system fun gamemodes nice tower selection solid graphics td games tend realistic absolutely terrible looking game finds sweet spot decent vital data bug need pay enjoy game fullest overlook love btd huge pros speak talk cons fist downloading vital data bug bug causes completely unable play game loading screen getting stuck downloading vital data forever happens seemingly random everybody staying days times requiring simple close reopen fix long long time makes game difficult play pc people heard happening mobile secondly game balance disagree feel like towers absolutely ing useless winning best tower race thousand miles examples dart monkey cheap extremely good early mid game requires zero support round factory slow good point game compared towers requires lot supportbanana farm gives massive head start economy sold defend rush counterrush rush usable map fullest extentbloonchipper combos towers destroy entire ceramic bloon layers upgrades entire zomg layers infinitely stall bloons large bloonchippers fix examples mid tier towers ninja monkey monkey apprentice sniper monkey ice tower perform need support towers examples balanced towers towers bit better bit worse makes higher levels play boil different strategies rest unable best best paying faster regenerating battle energy battle energy huge game battle energy showing little bit pay win beat energy buyers wrong like buying game money tower infinite zomg bloon popping power bit unfair advantage fact enter club room hours pass fact fully upgrade tower making somewhat unfair new players matched win loss record saying game pay win need pay experience good overall game negative little thought game balance micro transactions definitely change mind heck nerfing dart monkey supa vac absolutely massive difference stands game downsides despite game chore points

You can't bid when buying, put a mortgage on your cities (you can only sell entire cities, can't even sell single houses), or trade cities with other players so that you both agree on a price, you can just buy them back from others without even asking them.

1246,8973,8977,PlanetSide 2,"It had been 35 hours I have been playing this game, it's a very good game to play, if you are good enough, you won't have to use real life money to buy the equipment you need, using your money is only makingthe progress faster on your equipment. The thing that matters the most is the skill, not the weapon. If you got a weapon but you don't have any skill at using it, you won't able to control the recoil right, you won't know how many ammo you need to take down an enemy, you won't know what is the actual range of your weapon and you won't know how height you must aim to hit a target at distance. Yes this game has physics on bullet, meaning you need to aim higher for a target after a certain range, mainly if you use rifles or snipers, but even tanks, turrets and such like in real life, it would. But that also means you can use it to your advantage, if you have a basic of knowing physics, able to calculate the trajectory of the bullet before even shooting,it will make the difference between being spotted without killing and able to kill someone in matter of seconds. Of course, the community is somewhat balanced, but it seems there are many players are moving to a faction to another which can only make it unbalanced on the two others factions. The only thing lacking from players is to use tactics more than zerg tactics and dropping zergs on the capture zone. When it's not the case, the fight will mainly last forever like those fronts  in WWII. One thing I must say, it's not a  game for lone wolves, yes you may able to kill and capture things, but you will face a wall someday.

1249,1959,1962,Dota 2,"I dont usually write reviews but this is a game that I played really much because I enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare DotA 2 with. Basically in terms of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects.DotA 2 in a ""nutshell"" after ~2400h of playtime:-New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious.-IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market.-Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some ""never change a running system"" in this particular function.-Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employées (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english)-These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D*EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible...Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range). If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking).I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian.In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...Gameplay/Balance: 9/10Community: 2,5/10Rewards System: 1/10",0, nt usually write reviews game played enjoy genre tried games compare dota basically terms speed dota strife basically dota graphics style lol system level playing average think moba slower try league legends think faster try heroes newerth looking alternative knowledge based probably try heroes storm nt learn item effects dota nutshell players interested cosmetic items visit shop game drops incredibly rare buy item chests shop nt set bought sell items volvo cooldown months think new item gets released yay nt want spend money possible drop single chest rng strong better waiting desired item marketable buy greed simulator old loot system acutally gain items game dota profile levels leveling chest inventory opened profile levels contained new chest open later successfully reworked greed mode chances items game low getting legendary higher sure drop entire sets common rare overall rewards add singe items set drop chance item quantity value maybe try change running system particular developer support abandoned game new content game releases community hero sets workshop based hero releases patches rare special events year report system likely count based reviewed support employées example express annoyance lets russians able communicate english eu servers likely end muted players eu game probably likely russian report speaking days russian infested max games play result eyecancer russian chatspam servers way cooler international servers spam native language thanks volvo letting happen maybe day eu servers renamed russia russia actual eu play american servers addition listed issues game servers absolute games crash counted connection issues servers great job making worse ppl thought possible conclusion want play game rewarded playing terms cosmetic effects profile progression probably right choice anymore stated level rewards similar stuff anymore rare item drops probably range want blow steam trolling players spamming native language sure able understand probably gamechoice community days toxic troll based game gametime solo nt check games days community hon friendly russian personal opinion dota playable solo anymore games actually play properly annoyed trolls russians gameplay balance system

Then the game starts falling apart when some half-a** ed  think that tier-flattening on robocraft is good, and when they introduced epic l̶o̶o̶t̶  poop system. After you carried your whole team hard and scored the highest XP in every game, you get worthless♥♥♥♥♥♥for like 79 out of 80 games (despite earning the so-called protonium crate), while those that barely contributed to the team may earned a lengendary item from a silver or bronze crate.

This♥♥♥♥♥♥severely discourages people to improve and play well as the game barely rewards, or even punishes the skilled players with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crates.The matchmaking is also quite a joke. Instead of assigning a group of skilled players vs another group of skilled players to be more fair and equal, it is more likely that one or two elite players are put into a group of inexperienced noobs and newbies to ""balance"" a team, deliberately ruining the gameplay of those experienced players. In addition, the game does not consider the amount of flyers vs flaks when matchmaking, and so it is very common to see games where there are at least 4 flyers (or drones, to make things worse)♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a team with zero aeroflaks, or several aeroflaked robots being farmed by another all-grounded team.Speaking of drones, the introduction of camera control setting automatically make these space aids agile and operable by any 6-year old kids.

I would definitely recomend AdventureQuestWorlds to this one because, not only did some of the control scheme not work, but some things got more difficult, like picking up items.  In AQW the game would automatically collect items the enemies you kill yield, but in this you have to manually pick up drops, and added on with the bad camera control can make it infuriating to try to do.  I definitly think this game has potential if it were updatied to fix some of these issues as well as make it a little easier get a grip on if this is the first adventure quest game.",0, early access reviewi think game somewhat difficult play playing adventurequestworlds year definitely recomend adventurequestworlds control scheme work things got difficult like picking items aqw game automatically collect items enemies kill yield manually pick drops added bad camera control infuriating try definitly think game potential updatied fix issues little easier grip adventure quest game

1267,4644,4648,SMITE®,"I have never really written a review for any game on steam, but this game breaks that mold, in fact it breaks lots of molds in the MOBA genre in all. Its a MOBA game that uses a third person camera at all times, while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that makes the game uninteresting in a few moments of gameplay it does not. It always keeps my attention and I waste hours playing this game without even realising it and thats the thing. Whenever I try to play any other MOBA game (Dota 2/League of Legends) I get bored quickly because I feel like the action just isnt there. This game on the contrary is always filled with excitment and im always on my toes when I play this game. All of the Basic attacks are whats called ""skill shots"" meaning you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game. Unlike other MOBA games you do not click on the ground to move, instead you move with the WASD keys and you have to option to re bind them to something else. Currently the game has about 69 Gods to play as from different pantheons. Gods are essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a ""Champion"" if you will and they all look and sound Great! Hell the entire game looks amazing even when everything was turned down on low! The game modes vary from conquest (5V5) to Joust (3V3) and if that isnt enough you have a MOTD or a ""mode of the day"" which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of Classic 5V5. A MOTD is a random mode with the rules changed whether it be Extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone is already to the max level. In the end I could keep going about how amazing this game is ( I have played this for like a gazillion hours before it even came to steam) Or I could just end on saying, if you want to try a MOBA game thats a little diffrent but still fun Smite is your game!",1, written review game steam game breaks mold fact breaks lots molds moba genre moba game uses person camera times like quirky gimmic makes game uninteresting moments gameplay keeps attention waste hours playing game realising s thing try play moba game dota league legends bored quickly feel like action nt game contrary filled excitment m toes play game basic attacks s called skill shots meaning aim order kill game unlike moba games click ground instead wasd keys option bind currently game gods play different pantheons gods essentially character choose play champion look sound great hell entire game looks amazing turned low game modes vary conquest joust nt motd mode day add little life bored classic motd random mode rules changed extra money character mode max level end going amazing game played like gazillion hours came steam end saying want try moba game s little diffrent fun smite game

Be warned that if you intend to play, be prepared to spend many hours doing the simplest of functions, landing, getting used to controls, even firing weapons. It can be an arduous learning curve. My experience thus far has been in training or instant action trying to get it all down. It's not very intuitive or easy to do anything, so I think in the end, that sort of kills the fun, but it is a flight sim in part, so that is focus of the game. If you do not mind spending the time, it could get better I suppose. As of now, I am not having much fun other than flying the jet and experiencing that realism. The rest is a big chore.Update: This game is awfully difficult to pull together all the functions and have it be enjoyable, so I decided to quit while I am ahead and try an arcade flight game instead.

Sadly even when where to go was answered, only summed up to kill the baddy 20+ times.   Upon entering the 4th zone ""doomwood"" A SPIKE in difficulty seem to sprung but not unwelcome. Sadly it only had me FOR 5 HOURS being told by model Artix to kill 2 BASIC enemies a sum of 120 times. At one point when I struck lv.9 with an idea...  That rather then grind dungeons and grind quests to just GRIND BASIC MOBS. To the point that from start to lv. ding it would take 10,000 WOLFS to lv. I switched to quests and found that.... THATS WHAT I WAS DOING ALL ALONG! Kill 20 skeletons to be awarded exp equivalent to 20xWOLF KILLS! NOW GO AND KILL 30 WOLF FOR  EXP EQUAL TO 20 MORE WOLF KILLS!!!

The sound is amazing and the physics need just a little improvement. The tracks look amazing and the tracks made by the developer are fun and challenging. My only major critisism is the AI which is a long way in my opinion from being complete, they will ram you time and again if you're on a turn and they accelerate faster than you. The control system could use a little work and be more descriptive on how the sensitivity settings for controller (using a wired Xbox 360 controller until I can afford a descent steeling wheel rig) because after many sessions of tweaking the settings for steering acceleration I am still lost on how the settings affect my controller.

1306,6387,6391,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewA cool idea created by 15 years old horny teenagers that can't balance, can't design, can't ensure good performance (strong fps), and ultimately, can't make the game non p2w because of all of the above...Yes, technically speaking, this game is a ww2 clone of say, Planetside 2, in some of it's respects (combined arms)... but they have taken every possible mechanic in the game and broke it (they did fix planetside 2's lag, but maps are 100 times smaller so).On the surface, the game's premise looks decent. You have a series of progressively increasing maps that are decently sized and at first glance, look like they provide enough cover... Nothing could be further from the truth. The bigger the map gets, the bigger wasteland it becomes. At the end, at the biggest maps, you might as well be figting in Saudi Arabias Deserts with pine trees scattered throughout. No cover, no damage at any reasonable range by your weapons (even with a scope), a building here and then 500 meters later a building there, the checkpoints always in the middle of a bloody wasteland that you can't traverse without vehicles that arrent available anywhere, checkpoints that are a total of 5 meters squared and bombs that are damage 314 meters squared (10 m damage radius).It would be a sad excuse to call people that made this game developers. It would be a lie. They have no clue what they are doing, the only decent decision they made in the whole game is to enable headshots for the rifles from most reasonable ranges. Everything rest in this (formerly) p2w game (but still effectively p2w in many respects due to the completely broken game mechanics) that had it's free cash per hour increased 4x times yet still being too slow to grind is more or less awfull.So much promise, soooo little delivered in the end, like the vast majority of todays cookie cutter games. Saddest part about all of this is just how little it takes to fix more or less every issue i have with this game (just tweaking the damage settings so it stops being unbalanced (and a slight p2w) and tweaking the stupid maps so they stop being wastelands, i could manage the grind).A fail of a game whose only decent mode is depo (the first and smallest map).

1316,16695,16700,Bloons TD Battles,"While the game is super fun to play, it's very unlikely that you will play it for more than 15 minutes per session without having to spend money.If you're new to the game or starting fresh in the Steam version you'll soon realize that you will easily lose in the dumbest ways simply because either your opponent is a much higher level than you or because they have all of the good building unlocked. Since this is the case you are constantly having to use Dart Monkeys for camo baloons, Boomerang Monkeys for lead baloons, and using all of your energy to re-roll in vein that you either get a Bloonchipper, Cobra (which is easily the most broken thing about the game), or Monkey Sub. Either you can take days if not weeks to unlock them, while still needing medals to unlock all of their abilities, or you can buy each building for $4.99 each which is absurd. Once you run out of the initial 20 energy (which it takes 3 to roll each time) than you have to wait for it to regenerate. One energy takes 5 real-time minutes to come back so you often find yourself playing two matches, running out of energy, and turning the game off because you don't want to have to pay money for more.You have to get medals in order to unlock new buildings but you don't get any if you lose the match, which I've noticed that most players have a 60% winning streak or lower, so if you're like me and your winning streak is 50%, that means that half of the matches you've played were useless and just a waste of time because you got nothing for them.There is no ranked matching in the game so you will often come across players who have the most advance stuff unlocked at max tier with you only having the basics - so you'll suffer a loss just for getting unlucky which isn't fair. You can also buy the medals with money too.Pros:           • Fun GameplayCons:          • No Balancing          • Noob-Unfriendly          • Full of Microtransactions, which are pretty pricey          • Only fun in short bursts          • Too long and hard to unlock tower tiers without paying for themVerdict: While the game is fun and addicting it is very limiting unless you either wait for your energy to refill or spend money in a game that should have been $4.99 - $9.99 to begin with. If the pay-to-win aspect of the game wasn't such a problem than I would highly recommend this game but in it's current form I don't think it's worth your time. 5.6/10Stick to Bloons TD5 until they come out with a full version of this game.",0, game super fun play unlikely play minutes session having spend money new game starting fresh steam version soon realize easily lose dumbest ways simply opponent higher level good building unlocked case constantly having use dart monkeys camo baloons boomerang monkeys lead baloons energy roll vein bloonchipper cobra easily broken thing game monkey sub days weeks unlock needing medals unlock abilities buy building absurd run initial energy takes roll time wait regenerate energy takes real time minutes come find playing matches running energy turning game want pay money medals order unlock new buildings lose match noticed players winning streak lower like winning streak means half matches played useless waste time got ranked matching game come players advance stuff unlocked max tier having basics suffer loss getting unlucky fair buy medals money pros fun gameplaycons balancing noob unfriendly microtransactions pretty pricey fun short bursts long hard unlock tower tiers paying themverdict game fun addicting limiting wait energy refill spend money game begin pay win aspect game problem highly recommend game current form think worth time bloons come version game

1318,2756,2759,War Thunder,"After 70 hours in the clock I can say that I do not like this game. Mostly played arcade battles but also tried a few realistic battles here and there. Air battles are pretty fun, especially at low tiers where there is almost non-stop action all the time. But when climbing the ranks grinds between new aircraft become obviously longer and longer still. I can't even imagine what it's like at top tiers. Additionally most of the stock planes are pretty horrible so the game kinda suggests you to spend some real money to fasten up the process of advancing. The addicting sense of progression slowly dissipates and I can't see myself grinding any higher in the tech trees deliberately.Still, I have even more gripes with the tank battles and that's what's driving me away from this product. Of course the same grinding-related and stock vehicle issues are present in tank battles too but in my opinnion the battle mechanics are also a bit flawed. Problem is that War Thunder is pretty much vehicle oriented game almost like some of the simulators. Evidently developers have spent most of their time making vehicles feel and play realistically but forgot about fun factor. For example some of the maps are not very well desingned and some vehicles are pretty horribly balanced. A a result gameplay does not feel that good or fun at all. Needless to say, most of the game modes are very unimaginative too. Spawn camping and unevenly matched teams are pretty common. Sadly, well-modeled vehicles alone don't equate to fun and engaging gameplay.Effects of the origin of the game's developers cannot be overlooked either since vehicles of certain nation are pretty much overpovered or at least somehow better than the competing nations' vehicles across the board both in air and ground battles.Overall game looks and runs nice on my rig and there have been very few te♥♥♥♥♥al issues. I'm sure that the game is well made and all of that but it just feels a bit boring and bland after a while.

1332,7548,7552,Trove,"This is the most money demanding game I have ever found.  Basically you spend hours and hours of doing the same thing over.  Then the worse part, the luck.  If you wanna get something good dont expect it since everything has to be super rare forcing people to buy over priced packages.  Also if your trying to buy something that they dont have a pack for good luck.  The packs range from 10$ - 100$ there is very few 10$ packs though.  This game is P2W (pay to win) since everytime someone bought something in the 100$ packs they get something.  Although for those who bought a small pack that has like 1 - 10 super rare chest your not getting anything.  The best chance you got at getting something good is 75 chest.

1333,11018,11022,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a free to play card game that combines the best features of other franchises into one simple and elegant package with tonnes of strategic variation and depth, you've come to the right place.When you start playing this game, 3 things hit you immediately:1- The animation is fast and fluid. No time is wasted on flashy nonsense. The animations goes through quickly with minimal interruption, and still looks good! So most of your time is spent making decisions rather than impatiently watching stuff happen on screen.2- If you're familiar with Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, then this game feels instantly familiar and easy to learn.It doesn't suffer from the RNG self-destruction vomit that Hearthstone has become.And it has a much more modern online client interface than the outdated relic of MtG online.3- Despite being in early access, it already has so much content. And even without having a full library of legendary cards, you have sooo many options in deck construction, strategy and interaction without paying a single dime.I was so impressed with the elegant design of all the cards and in-game interface that I bought some of the in-game currency just to support the developers. But I did not need it! You can earn and craft all the cards by playing very casually.There are several modes to play:1- Gauntlet: Against AI decks. Here you can test your new deck concepts and do some casual grinding for Gold. Extremely useful. And surprisingly challenging.2- Forge: Also against AI. This is basically Arena or Draft but against AI. It costs half as much Gold to enter than with Draft, and the Draft itself is cheap anyways. Forge is good if you love Draft/Arena gameplay but don't like to wait for other players or don't like competitive play too much.3- Draft: You open a pack and pick one card. Then you pass it on to someone else, and you pick another card from a pack passed by someone else etc.... until the pack is empty. And then you repeat the process for a total of 4 times.Then you construct a deck from the cards you picked and play PVP. If you enjoy the competition and have the brains to stay competitive, this mode can earn you A LOT of gold, packs and Shiftstone (used to craft cards). Best of all, you keep the cards that you picked! including the ones you did not use to make your deck.4- Ranked: PVP Just like constructed in hearthstone. Nothing special. I actually prefer constructed over Draft due to the incredible creativity of the community. But that's just a personal preference. I like to test new concepts cuz it's so much fun.Casual: PVP but without rank points. Useful if you just want to enjoy the gameplay and complete quests without affecting your current rank.5- Events: Every now and then, we get an event with special rules. I really like these because they make you THINK and build your decks in specific ways to capitalise on the battlefield conditions. Plus, they are incredibly rewarding, so it's worth the effort.In addition, there are quests that require you to play certain colors or card types to unlock chests. This encourages you to get creative and try new things. Just the usual card game incentives...I've seen most reviews and Steam discussions complaining about the resource system (mana) borrowed from Magic The Gathering. Indeed, you have to play Sigils (lands) to gain power (mana) and play your cards.Truth be told, the number of spells that draw Sigils are somewhat limited. MtG had many more mana fetching and fixing cards. In Eternal you need to give extra attention to include enough Sigil fetching cards in your decks. Seek Power and Find the Way are EXTREMELY important. And card draw engines are a MUST HAVE in every deck strategy. Otherwise you will be at the mercy of top decks by turn 7.If you can get accustomed to the mana system and start brainstorming deck ideas, you're gonna LOVE this game, especially if you like to be creative.If you can't be bothered, feel free to net deck. Many new players net deck at first. In fact, the community is very generous and intelligent. And they love to share their ideas with new players.Whatever your playstyle is, there is a deck for you. Feel free to experiment. You'll be surprised by the magnitude of unlikely synergies you can discover. It's very enjoyable to have this EUREKA!! moment when testing new combos. Eternal really encourages you to try new cards.There are a few slightly overused or unbalanced cards, but most of them are cheap to craft and everything can be easily countered with the right strategy. The Silence mechanic is particularly powerful and almost essential to counter certain effects. I'm a little worried about the Silence tbh, and I really hope they add a Revert mechanic similar to Hex: Shards of Fate. Otherwise, Silence effects would have to be deliberately kept few in number from now on because it's counter-interactive and not very fun.As far as card games go, I give this a solid 7/10.If the devs keep an eye out on card balance and maintain their caution when releasing new cards, this game will be an excellent addition to any card game player's library, especially if you're tired of the old franchises that have become overburdened with their outdated online clients.Try it and keep an open mind.

1334,10147,10151,theHunter Classic,"Ok, So I played this game a while back (after developer change but before steam) and would like to say, yes it is a good game. It is a good game with some very nice hunting. But I cannot say it is a great game. There is long walks with nothing to shoot. I have had 3 hour game sessions where I only found one red fox and nothing else despite the fact that I have traversed the entire map and sat for a good while at a stand. Sometimes, there is just a lul in things to shoot. While yes this realistic, can't say it is very fun for a game.Also, it is very, very expensive to play this game. I can tell you it is almost no fun to play the one map and hunt only the mule deer and ignore all the other tracks and sounds you hear. It is frustrating. Also you can't create multiplayer games and you can't always find multiplayer games that you can hunt in. So it is singleplayer for you. This might actually be a better idea because if you do play multiplayer with strangers, people like to follow you and make lots of noise. It can be maddning to finally find that mule deer, get your sights on him, and then have the guy that had been following you run up, pull up his gun, shoot, and completely miss scaring the deer away and anything else that might be around.I just think you should be able to do more without spending money or at least have more in-game ways to earn money and buy licenses.

1339,14423,14428,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewOkay so Robocraft used to be a good game. That is as simple as I can make this. I used to love logging in and building robots and fighting against other people, seeing creativity and combat come together like some brilliant child fantasy of building things out of lego and smashing them together, or whatever. But seriously, what the f*** happened? After about 5 good games of robocraft I could walk away with on average around 200,000 to 500,000 in the game currency and buy loads of cool items and build loads of new robots with crazy designs. BUT. Now it's so disgusting, the entire combat sytem is somewhat still enjoyable, but now, you've got to be so good at the game to get some weird loot reward thing at the end of a match to get items that YOU DON'T EVEN WANT. I think in one game i was rewarded a 'protanium chest' or whatever (which i beleive is the best loot box you can get) and I got absolutely f*** all in it. I sold the crap from the box for abour 2,000 'Robits'. How the hell are new people playing the game supposed to get money to build a robot? I'm stuck with the three worst robots in exsistence and i can't do f*** all about it. I'm struggling to fight againts people who were lucky enough to have a good robot built before this 'apocalype' update occured. This game seriously needs to be fixed, like back to the way it used to be when you could actually get money to upgrade your bots and do well in matches so you can actually have fun. Honestly, the people behind this game are absolute idiots, they need to wake up and realise that what they are doing is putting players off completely. I do not recommend this game AT ALL. However I do recomend that you cry like a baby like me so that we players who USED to love the game can enjoy it once more.

1341,7758,7762,Trove,"This game is one of my favorites and for good reasons. The community of this game is nice and everyone is usually kind to each other besides the occasional scammers and spammers (like every other MMO). The game is not for everyone and I understand that, but if you enjoy murdering everything and going through dungeons with friends this game is for you. There is something of everyone in this game, for people who like to build you can join a club and creat whatever or simply design you cornerstone (base that moves throughout worlds). Or if you like murdering people in PVP and mounting the trophys of people you killed on your wall (literally) then you can do that to!   No this game is not a PTW (pay to win) game. It's optional to use money but if you don't you still can play the game fine. There are new things being added all the time and millions of weapons, hats, masks, costumes, ect. The art style for the game is called Voxel and easy to make new items and submit them and potentially have them added to the game! There are many different classes to choose from if your into games with diverse characters. And yes some are better than others. One of my favorite features in this game is the cornerstone. Within Different worlds you will find a cornerstone plot and pressing E on the sign will build your cornerstone, if you build/destroy anything on it those edits will be transferred throughout worlds (every world has cornerstone plots).    The controls for this game are simple (or many just because I'm used to them). Some controls are weird so just ask in global chat and people usually respond. Another great feature is if you have a weapon that looks bad but does good danger you are able to ""collect"" the good looking weapon and change the appearance of the bad looking weapon but still keeping the better stats, same with hats and masks. Anyway this game is a lot of fun and you should stop reading this and go play it.

Of course, that also makes all rare gear you get from dungeons and levelups feel meaningless too. Everything's already dying in two hits regardless, what difference does it make?Oh, and then there's the Auto-Run to Quest Objective feature. Because nothing spells out ""adventure"" like literally going on rails.

There is really no reason to play it. If you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want. Or you can just pay for it. Sadly it looks like the money men won out with this game. They got rid of all the good stuff so little kids can just hop on and get everything they want, or  buy what they want. If you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that took time, effort, and game knowledge. Your looking at the wrong game now. This has gone over to the kiddy freemium side. It was a great game that made you want to work to unlock better guns, wheels, and armor. Now you can just get the best items in the game if you do well in a match. I left after the huge bot update that had everyone hidding behind the big bot in the front because it got really boring like COD got. You just shot back and forth until you killed the medic bots behind the huge bot. So I left and now when I come back hoping to find that they evened things out and maybe added a few more game modes.

1364,8285,8289,Neverwinter,"It works fine as a free to play. keep in mind there are some pay walls that although grindable, would take many months.- you will never have a fast mount (60% inc is the base)- you will never have the best item enhancements (yours will be half as good, approx.)- it's pay to win.. do not pvp unless you are paying or enjoy getting 1 shot.The game itself has a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spells on your action bar, which are players choice, but it's not much and gets repetitive fast. It takes about 30 hours to get to max level, then due to the 'daily' system for the 4 high level zones (where you unlock better gear and harder dungeons) it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned players.Character roles are a bit odd compared to other mmo's, if you are good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeons without a tank or healer, even at high level the healer is more for buffing the other players than actually keepin them alive, i.e. not a vital part of the team. the tank has the same issue with none tanks able to go off soloing in dungeons.

1378,1554,1557,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI know i know... less than 3 hours played... clearly not enough time spent to fully appreciate this game.Oh, you just realized its EARLY ACCESS? moving right along...As of 3/4/15 this is what i think of the game:AwesomeOne map so far.A handful of ships to use, all different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. (Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots; making thier death that much easier. And the point difference between killing a player and a bot is marginal. You get around 40 more xp for killing a player.Graphics are wonderful. The deatail on the ships is well done. Turrets move with your cursor, thrusters fire off with movement (Small thrusters on different parts of the ship for turns), and damage to different hit locations are amazing. I.E. You take a bunch of damage to the engines, its starts to burn and spark. So far, no actual impedement of abililties/ movement from ship damage. Shading is well done. Its nice to be able to see an enemys' shadow on an asteroid before he cloaks, giving you at least an idea of where he is at.Sound is great. Voices are well done, for what they are in the current state of the game. Mostly little reminders of where enemies are attacking and such.Controls are ok. its nice to have different keys for up and down movement, but after playing any other space flight game it kind of seems a bit unneeded. just add mouse based movement (would be my best suggestion, with the add of cruise control that actually WORKS lmao). i dont know.. id be more used to it if i wasnt playing Star Conflict in the same day.Overall this game is a WIN.

1379,8875,8879,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewFrom someone who pushed Masters in the first week of the game releasing, this game was incredibly unique, amazing and different to every Battle Royale game that I had played. The crafting system was perfect that forced people to fight at the start and win battles in order to reap the rewards of a legendary weapon, the risk of dropping in a populated area had a pay off because if you won, you came out on top with legendary weapon and gear to craft. Now? My team mate drops, and instantly a guy gets his legendary weapon in the first chest and deletes everyone nearby. RNG to this extent in a Battle Royale game should never be allowed, and it has completely broken the game. Once this change is looked at, or reverted, I will happily play the game again. You should never encourage people to avoid fights and loot in a fast paced Battle Royale game, and there should never be RNG aspects to that extent of someone winning a fight. Cannot recommend in its current state. Developers are all over the place and change the game on an almost daily basis. ASK YOUR COMMUNITY FIRST about changes, after all, we are the players that play your game.",0, early access reviewfrom pushed masters week game releasing game incredibly unique amazing different battle royale game played crafting system perfect forced people fight start win battles order reap rewards legendary weapon risk dropping populated area pay won came legendary weapon gear craft team mate drops instantly guy gets legendary weapon chest deletes nearby rng extent battle royale game allowed completely broken game change looked reverted happily play game encourage people avoid fights loot fast paced battle royale game rng aspects extent winning fight recommend current state developers place change game daily basis ask community changes players play game
1380,11240,11244,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI have a lot hours in this game and I think I can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game. Also the review I'm giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competively than casually. Let's start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldn't be in here.    - 75 Card Decks:    The decks that you make have to be 75 cards instead of the standard 60 that are common in most other games. This makes deckbuilding and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare. There are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game (and trust me I built them), but with 75 cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced. The deck size should be 60 cards, and then you have a 15 card side board (though sideboards don't matter in this game either and I'll explain later).    - Mulligan:       Doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb. In this game if you don't like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven. Unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason, so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause youre stuck with it. Let me give you an example of how it should be. If you ever played Magic the Gathering (another better card game) before, the way their system works is like this, you start with seven cards if you don't like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to four cards, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to three (though this never happens) etc, etc... The point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason.    - Coin Flip:      Normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing. Eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you HAVE to go first. Now in other games when you do a coin flip, the winner has the option if they want to go first or not, I know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first (It doesn't happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to). This is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesn't trust their player base to make their own decisions.     - Best out of ONE:       This is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore. For some reason ranked matches are a best of ONE, basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank. Sometimes in games you are bound to get unluckly  with draws but thats why in most other cards games when you play competively, you play your opponent the best of THREE. For the life of me I have no idea why the game is like this, I can't begin to tell you how absoultely frustated you will feel when you are playing ranked, and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you can't cause eternal only allows two for some reason, and you wind up losing the game cause of it, but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up. It's absoultley ridculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competive play.     - Unbalanced Cards:       Some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken, and by that I mean you essentially have no way to lose. Some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essientially has no way to win, the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first, I've played tons of other card games before (Magic, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon) and I can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards I've ever seen.     - Drafing sucks:       Finally the last point that I want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game. For drafting in eternal you aren't drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go, instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people (there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here), these drafts aren't with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built. Also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is 45 cards, this isn't as much of a big deal since you draft 48 cards in total but I just find it odd. Also draft matches are not the best out of three, they are again the best out of ONE. It's so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from, so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it, so if you get awful hands well too bad f@#$ you cause now you lose the match.Here is the good things about Eternal...     - It's free and it will only take you 50 hours of grinding to get a semi good deck if you don't want to spend money.Overall, if you are looking for a card game to play online to take more seriously just go play Hearthstone,  Magic Online, or Magic Arena.",0, early access reviewi lot hours game think safe waste time playing game review giving strictly people interested finding playing card game competively casually let start things wrong game card decks decks cards instead standard common games makes deckbuilding playing deck absolute nightmare lists find online tier decks game trust built cards deck consistency drawing cards way deck supposed play significantly reduced deck size cards card board sideboards matter game explain later mulligan standard mulligan game dumb game like seven card hand starter chance shuffle cards redraw seven unfortunately mulligan reason mulligan hand sucks bad cause stuck let example played magic gathering better card game way system works like start seven cards like starting hand shuffle redraw cards like hand cards like hand happens etc etc point player hand eternal complete restricts reason coin flip normally play card game sort coin flip goes playing eternal reason picked games coin flip winner option want know sounds weird times person going happen trust want pet peeve mind goes eternal trust player base decisions best doubt annoying thing game utterly frustating basically want play anymore reason ranked matches best basically getting terrible starting hands guaranteed lose match lose points rank games bound unluckly draws s cards games play competively play opponent best life idea game like begin tell absoultely frustated feel playing ranked starting hand bad wish mulligan cause eternal allows reason wind losing game cause lose points trying rank absoultley ridculous goes eternal competive play unbalanced cards cards game mechanics straight broken mean essentially way lose cards game grossly good play opponent essientially way win game basically race play best card played tons card games magic hearthstone yu gi oh pokemon safely eternal ridiculous cards seen drafing sucks finally point want bad draft system set game drafting eternal drafting group seven people live like drafts normally instead limitless time choose cards packs rotated random people little works online want look exactly drafting works drafts group essentially takes fun draft normally people draft fun play people passing packs cards took decks built eternal weird thing deck build draft cards big deal draft cards total find odd draft matches best best dumb draft random cards pick deck bound inconsistencies awful hands bad cause lose match good things eternal free hours grinding semi good deck want spend money overall looking card game play online seriously play hearthstone magic online magic arena

1383,1005,1008,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewIt is:MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena I will take it it is a MOBA but doesn't have typical 3 lanes nor creeps. This is a battle of large capital ships. Even though ships are sluggish at the begining, games are not so slow and usually last 25 minuts. Game is built around team in mind in every aspect. To level up, whole team must take mining stations so entire team gets new level (ship upgrades). It is not possible to level up by killing ship but team with more ships get advantage - one player more means more firepower, more means to capture mines or infiltrate enemy base. Technically, feeding is not granting enemy any direct advantage.Ships do feel big and behave big. There are no plans to put in small combat ships - it is not the point of this game. Every ship feels different so with every unlocked ship, player must learn how to use it properly. Some ships have similar usage tho. Graphics are great but it is in early access and some optimization is needed.There are no paywalls not pay-to-win mechanics. In store there are only skins and items that can be purchased for ingame credits too. NOTE: Skins can be purchased only with real money.Game lack bigger player base.

Forgive my profane remarks, but I was under the impression that this would be a joke game, kind of silly. But I was wrong, oh was I so so dearly wrong.

At least until that... little girl. Ugh. The main horrors are based off of a myriad of different horror games. There is a slime monster, that I just equate to Slimer from Ghostbusters. There is a spider that is from Resident Evil. There is a little ghost girl whom I can only assume is from F.E.A.R. And then the return of death incarnate for me. Silent Hill references.

1391,12254,12258,Bless Online,"Early Access Review**EDIT** 6/14/18 - Please read this before reading below. I'm not going to delete my past review. I meant it when I wrote it. But my opinion has changed since. I no longer recommend this game. The developers DO NOT LISTEN to the community. Let me start by saying, when the content creators the company chose can no longer be silent  and they are making content about the giant flaws, you know it's not looking good. At first, we asked for more content. In response, we got 15v15 PvP (okay, cool), a promise for more content coming soon (cool), andddd a massive damage nerf across the board (WHAT?!). I'll get back to that later.There were people duping items and people making ridiculous amounts of gold off of easy to farm materials that had a price that was literally 100x higher than other materials. These players ended up getting a major leg up on other players before these issues were fixed, but their gold and items seemed to still remain. There were rumors these players got anywhere from a 3-15 day ban, all the way to their accounts were deleted. Regardless of what actually happened to them, this left the market in a terrible spot. Trading was introduced... It doesn't work and wasn't mentioned in patch notes. We found it accidentallyBut back to class balancing... The balancing after the first large nerf was shaky and it seemed like they were just letting loose reckless adjustments (not slight ones either), hoping that it would hit the mark and solve the problem. Rangers got a ridiculous amount of cdr on skills, berzerkers = trashed, guardians = nerfed, paladins left with spitball damage and nothing but an inconsistent cc combo chain and a heal, and so on. Some of us thought that getting our hands on current ""end game"" gear would help compensate for these nerfs, but that ended up being a dream that was swiftly crushed.Players started getting to max level (45) and realized that the drop rates for the purple grade, level 45 gear are VERY small (something close to 5%). That sounds bad, but it's worse once you realize it's 5% just for a random class gear piece with a random rune slot to be shared by the whole party. We were told this was intentional, not a bug.These gear pieces dropped from the level 43 and 45 dungeons. The level 43 dungeon was insanely difficult post damage nerf. There is a bug that can cause infinite mobs to spawn if you wipe in a certain spot. Final Bosses enrage timer is notorious. Beating this is the only way to get master crafting quest done. The 45 dungeon is easier than the 43, not even worth mentioning. But these dungeons can only be accessed twice a day, which means your grind for this purple gear is even more limited. Since then, we have been begging for:- End game drop rates to be fixed- Crafting materials to drop so we can craft blue grade, level 37 armor (we couldn't even get the material to craft it, which meant constantly running the level 37 dungeon until you got your entire set as drops), - Runes (boost gear stats) to not all break on PvE deathInstead, we got a new world boss and a silent nerf (was not mentioned in the patch notes) that took the set bonus from the level 45 purple grade gear and spiked it into the ground. I brought up this ninja nerf in the official discord and I was banned from talking because I was ""spreading rumors about the game"". But other players started noticing and confirming the level 45 purple gear nerf and some of the officials in the Discord went silent.Now, you might ask: ""Why are you upset? A new world boss? That's the content you had asked for in the beginning!"" Well... Optimization is still non existent, silent nerfs are a terrible business practice, and the world bosses drop trash (unless you're extremely lucky).There's a lot more. I had high hopes Neowiz would turn things around, I tried to keep an open mind and embrace it as early access, but it's obvious they don't care.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5/28/18 - This is going to be a very long post. I'll start my review by saying this: Yes, I recommend this game. I find the pieces that make it fun outweigh those that drag it down. If you're looking for an incredibly well polished UI/experience with perfect translations, this is NOT the game for you. Here are pros, cons, recommendations for the developers, and a discussion.Pros:- Fun combat, the combo system feels nice imo.- Very fun PvP. A guild mate and I accidentally started a faction war in an open area last night and spent two hours laughing while we and the Union zergs kept going at it.- Taming system is really fun. Nothing like riding a giant caterpillar into battle.- Large world.- Dungeons are fun.- Mix between PvE and PvP is well done.- Not P2W.- Crafting and Gathering is a rather smooth experience.- Regardless of what everyone else is saying, the devs are trying. They just issued a public apology for the rough start and have been very on top of fixing issues. That alone is a pro that most people don't give credit for. Yes, it's their job, but so many other Early Access games almost never make it to a full release and leave their product dead and unfixed. So props there.Cons:- Poor optimization (This can be EASILY fixed by editing an .ini file (the fixes are all over Reddit, it's not hard to find)- Very poor translations. - Servers are somewhat unstable (supposed to be fixed during this maintenance).- Market board is buggy. I would be more forgiving on this point if there were trading or another way to trade/sent items to friends and guild mates, but currently it involves:   > one person posting an item on the market board for the minimum value allowed   > a few minutes of waiting,    > the ""receiver"" trying to grab the item before someone else does (but the search doesn't always work, so it's means spamming to try and get the item to show up to even figure out if it's posted).- Some parts of the game haven't been implemented yet (see Recommendations and Discussion).Recommendations:- Build on the guild experience. Add a guild chest, guild house, etc., more content for us to do as a group - Add way for us to help out other guild members with gear instead of trying to go to the market place at the same time and one of us trying to scoop up whatever the other just posted for as cheap as they can post it.- Accelerate the addition of existing content. We have gear dropping for assassin/mystic, but don't have the classes. Also, we have dungeons for the current level cap that don't drop loot. Because of this, there's no incentive to do those dungeons. We also have slevel (for unlocking the last 2 skills/traits), content beyond level 45, and other pieces of the game that I would love to experience, but they are still unavailable.Discussion:As mentioned in the pros, the PvPvE balance is done well. It will only get better as content is added.I am shocked that so much of the community dove into a game that is labelled as early access, bought a Founder's Pack to get a HEAD START in EARLY ACCESS (Early early access??) and are raging about the imperfections. Yes, the game has been released in 3 other regions, it should be at least more well optimized. But that also means we knew what bugs to expect. If they aren't fixed on the other regions, why would they bring us the game all polished and not bring it to the other regions first (where these players have been waiting)? Also, regarding the server issues, I personally feel as though they didn't expect some of the larger streamers to bring attention (and more people) to this game, causing queue times and full servers.They are even being very lenient on refunds for people who are absolutely unsatisfiable. That's a great move by them honestly.Tl;DR -there are problems, it's early access, it's to be expected.

This game has taken a turn for the worst and I won't be playing it until TF2 returns to how it once was. Not only is the wait time completely inconvienient, but many custom huds won't work with the menu either.Many people are quitting, Valve, take note of that.

1413,1375,1378,Fractured Space,Early Access ReviewThis game is very much like MOBAs where it pits 5 players against 5 other players in an arena sort of combat. but instead of having to buy heroes or something you instead get to research toward space ships in a fashion similar to World of Tanks or similar games. when players leave there is a sort of balance system in place to where it is still possible to have victory over a larger team. what ship type you pick and what you're up against is not entirely what decides the game. it is how well you play that ship,1, early access reviewthis game like mobas pits players players arena sort combat instead having buy heroes instead research space ships fashion similar world tanks similar games players leave sort balance system place possible victory larger team ship type pick entirely decides game play ship
1414,6019,6023,DCS World Steam Edition,"Pretty good overall, just a few bugs/glitches when you go from the Main Screen to Multiplayer aka the servers.

1419,13041,13045,Fallout Shelter,"Why such games are created?Is it because the developer is that much incompetent?Is it because of laziness?Coming from Bethesda, I'd say that it is both.Seriously, the MMOs, the mobile gaming and the console gaming has destroyed the gaming industry.We get crap like that instead of getting a real Fallout game, when was the last time we had a real Fallout game? Last time I checked it was in 2010.Fallout 4? Please, that's not Fallout.If they were competent enough, they wouldn't care about the mainstream, we could get a Fallout similar to the first one or second.But nope, too complicated, let's make something that even a 8 years old kid could make and let's make it a game for everyone, even if they are not real gamers but just posers and fakers who only played games such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and all those other crappy Facebook/mobile crap that should not even exist in the first place.I'm seriously tired of this crap, and the worse is that people seems to encourage that kind of crap.A message to the developers and publishers; if you really want to make such low quality crap, then keep it for the consoles and the mobile gaming, I'll talk for the real PC gamers community;  we want real games, we want a true Fallout experience. Not the kind of crap that required you to be always online to play (no offline play), that has microtransactions and that looks exactly the same as those crappy games made by incompetents you can find on Facebook.Honestly, I don't know where this is going, but crap, as a gamer, it hurts.And to those who's gonna come and say ""you can be a real gamer even if you have only played Call of Duty or Candy Crush"".Well, I have nothing to say to you.Call of Duty may be is a crappy game but oh well, at least it's a game, those Facebook and mobile ""games"", what are they? You could spend more than 600$ and you'd be kind of done with the game, and if you don't pay, either it will be really slow to progress and you won't be able to get/access to everything or you just won't be able to advance at all.Don't get me wrong, I love some grind, in games that are fun to play and that you don't have to pay with real money to speed up the process or whatever.And as long as it is fair, I don't want to spend my life finishing one game.We, adults have obligations and other stuff.And even if I could be a kid for the rest of my life, I wouldn't want to waste my time on just one game, especially not a crappy one such as this one.This game is cancer, Bethesda is cancer, this new generation of gaming industry is cancer and i'm honestly tired of this kind of crap, I'll just go live under a rock in the woods so I won't have to look at this kind ofI want real games, games that the developer could really be proud of, that the true gamers would really love, I'd be willing to spend more money on expansions and real content.But nope, it almost look like they want to burn the gaming industry down.But of course, there are kids who will ask for daddy and mommy money so they can buy in-game trash they won't even need, or a game that is just utterly crap.Or some idiots who doesn't seems to understand what quality and content is.If you got offended or feel like you've been aimed at by this review, then that's your problem, you know what it means.Honestly, this game doesn't even deserves 1/10.No effort at all, hell, I wouldn't even play this game on a tablet or a phone.I'd prefer to play Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or some old games that were on the consoles back when consoles were good and actually had good games.Even if you're a mobile game lover (how?), this game is riducule, idea could be great if it was well made, AI is dumb (they can't even do stuff such a killing mole rats or anything that happen in the vault by themselves, you have to treat them like babies and do everything for them), stats, RNG, all of that, it's all bullcrap, seriously, I could go all day long on flaws and I wouldn't even be done so i'll stop it here, read other negative reviews but from people who likes mobile gaming but not this game and if they explain it well, you'll understand.Otherwise, if you're a PC player like me, just ignore this game at all cost and go play Fallout 2 or even Fallout: New Vegas.I want the gaming industry to work, but it just doesn't right now, I want real games, I want developers and publishers to understand that the number one rule when it comes to video games is not to try to make the most money out of it and hoping that the game is good but to put the most efforts on the game so it can be really good and to hope that it will bring you money.Look at The Witcher 3, I use this example often because it is a great game, no Denuvo crap, no anti-piracy crap, a fair price for a great game, the best we had in the recent years, that's how it should be done.And look at how much money they made, of course, people are happy with it, unlike a game that has Denuvo, always online drm, which punish more the player who pays than the opposite.If you are smart enough, you should notice that developers and publishers are either brainless or that they just don't care about their fans.Why did we get a game like this in the first place? Why did Bethesda went the mainstream way?Why should we favor the non gamers and posers above all?I seriously miss the video games from the 90's, sure, some few were bad, but most of the times, they tried, today, you can't say much about it.It seriously pains me to see where the video game industry has come to.The same could be said about music, movies, pretty much everything.But the human race is simply stupid, what can we do about it?Note: I am not against casual games, despise being more of an hardcore gamer, I do love some casual games some times, but the real thing you know, not the kind of crap you find on Facebook and mobile phones.",0, games developer bethesda seriously mmos mobile gaming console gaming destroyed gaming industry crap like instead getting real fallout game time real fallout game time checked fallout competent care mainstream fallout similar second nope complicated let years old kid let game real gamers posers fakers played games duty candy crush crappy facebook mobile crap exist place seriously tired crap worse people encourage kind crap message developers publishers want low quality crap consoles mobile gaming talk real pc gamers community want real games want true fallout experience kind crap required online play offline play microtransactions looks exactly crappy games incompetents find facebook honestly know going crap gamer hurts gon na come real gamer played duty candy duty crappy game oh game facebook mobile games spend kind game pay slow progress wo able access wo able advance wrong love grind games fun play pay real money speed process long fair want spend life finishing game adults obligations stuff kid rest life want waste time game especially crappy game cancer bethesda cancer new generation gaming industry cancer honestly tired kind crap live rock woods wo look kind ofi want real games games developer proud true gamers love willing spend money expansions real content nope look like want burn gaming industry course kids ask daddy mommy money buy game trash wo need game utterly crap idiots understand quality content got offended feel like aimed review problem know means honestly game deserves effort hell play game tablet phone prefer play final fantasy dragon quest old games consoles consoles good actually good games mobile game lover game riducule idea great ai dumb stuff killing mole rats happen vault treat like babies stats rng bullcrap seriously day long flaws stop read negative reviews people likes mobile gaming game explain understand pc player like ignore game cost play fallout fallout new vegas want gaming industry work right want real games want developers publishers understand number rule comes video games try money hoping game good efforts game good hope bring money look witcher use example great game denuvo crap anti piracy crap fair price great game best recent years look money course people happy unlike game denuvo online drm punish player pays opposite smart notice developers publishers brainless care fans game like place bethesda went mainstream favor non gamers posers seriously miss video games sure bad times tried today seriously pains video game industry come said music movies pretty human race simply stupid casual games despise hardcore gamer love casual games times real thing know kind crap find facebook mobile phones

1426,10153,10157,theHunter Classic,"Okay, let me start by saying a couple of things.  One.  Yes, I absolutely recommend this game.  Two.  Yes, the payment model is an absolute mess and some things that are paid are just silly.  However, under said payment model there are also a lot misconceptions (mostly concerning licenses and ammo) due to a lack of explanation on the devs end and also YouTubers doing reviews on games that they've played for 8 minutes and 7 seconds.  Allow me to break it all down for you.The Payment Model and Memberships     Let me just start by saying that I'm not here to defend this business model because it is atrocious and is not my favorite by a long shot.  I know there are a lot of players that won't try this game because of half-cocked reviews and lack of explanation.  Expansive Worlds, this is also your fault.  Don't charge for trophy shot poses... C'mon.      Okay, okay, the store... Ugh, yes every weapon (pretty much) is paid.  Here's the thing.  You don't need every weapon out of the gate, that's just silly.  So the way it works is Hunterscore.  Hunterscore is a based on a total point count that comes from reaching various milestones.  Your first kill is your first milestone (PER WEAPON and PER SPECIES).  From there you are given points to your score for 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 kills.  Yes, every weapon (apart from a few exclusives that don't contribute to the score) requires 1000 kills to achieve the maximum hunter score.  So day one, you want to try the game out and feel overwhelmed by the amount of weapons for sale.  That's normal.  Even the starting .243 requires 1000 kills.  Start with it.  It takes a long time to get that 1000 kills.  Max it and get another weapon every 2-3 weeks. Or buy everything in the game at once and send your wife into a coma like I did :)  Let me explain why that's pointless.  I own all the things!  COOL!  Except it's not.  I now have 18, 52, 11 rifles that have 1-30 kills each and the chances that I'll reach 1000 with them are now so low that my brother can't even walk under them (he's short).  Point:  Get a weapon or two and go with them for the first while.Okay B00M, I bought a weapon but there's no way I'm going to keep buying ammo for it when it runs out.     That's where the membership comes in.  It's $9.99 for 3 months.  It's not that bad.  What makes it bad is all of the other stuff in unison.  Clothing, weapons, scent eliminators.  With that membership your ammo will not run out.  Each rifle, pistol and bow come with 30 rounds or arrows (150 for the .22 and .17).  Birdshot for a shotgun come with 90.  Those numbers are per hunt.  Once they are gone they are only gone for that hunt.  Start up another and you'll see it right back in your lodge.  But it's not enough ammo for a hunt!     Yes, yes it is.  Stop shooting holes in the clouds and trying to saw down trees with arrows.  It's not helping.  If you are sending 30 rounds through a .243 in 15 minutes then you're doing it wrong.  If you shoot that bad at a walking target you should be spending your time at the range and not in the field.Cool, I'm not buying a license for each animal either.      No?  Well, neither am I because that's stupid on 318 levels.  If you bought one for an animal then I'm not calling you stupid.  Thaw out snowflake and keep reading.  That same membership takes care of that as well.  If you want to play one hunt a month and have a life outside of games then the individual license may be more practical for you.  Long term players should not be touching those silly things.As far as clothing and all the other stuff goes, listen up.      A lot of that is preference (not all).  The outfit matters as each one has certain effects on certain animals.  It's not that drastic.  Yes, you'll blend better with the appropriate camo but it won't be game breaking to play without it until you decide to get it.  I also bought all the clothing (she's still hotter that 400 Hells).      Tents, stands and things like that are quality of life.  If you want them, buy them.  If not, the game won't force close and take you to the store with it's hand out.  On a side note, tents serve as spawn points and with the reserves being quite large, I recommend a couple but that's entirely up to you.  I've probably skipped out on 100 rares jumping around the reserve.  Walking from place to place is never a bad idea anyway.Callers     Callers are one of the more reasonably priced items in the game (compared to the other stuff) but can still get a little expensive if all are bought at once.  Nickel and dime from week to week or month to month and it's not bad.  Also, look at the caller bundles.Duck/Goose blinds     LOL stay away from ducks and geese until you are sure you want to stay for the long haul because a fowl setup is outright dumb as far as payment.  A blind and decoy spread can run you nearly $30...  People that have travelled across the country with 3 of their exes in the car have spent less money than us fowl hunters in this game.EM's and GM's       Em's are paid and Gm's are earned and also a little on the useless side.  Gm's are great for things like scents and scent eliminators but that's about the extent of it.  There are a few other things which you can browse the store to see.  Em's can also be earned by placing in competitions and from the UHC website where there are player made competitons and payouts (much higher payouts).Okay, so I'm interested in it now.  Is it fun?     Absolutely, the sounds, visuals and scope of the game are second to none as far as hunting games.  Each animal is unique with it's very own score card that breaks down details to levels that I don't even bother reading haha.  The reserves are large and the optional content is through the roof if not terribly overpriced.  Play with friends, join competions (Em payouts) and do missons (Gm payouts).     Listen, if you read the review then I appreciate you taking the time to do so.  If you still feel like it's too expensive to play then I totally understand that.  If you want to stick around and play, then tinker with the free content before getting a membership.  Just remember that without a membership this game is lacking and it's almost a requirement.  If you have any questions or would like to be shown the ropes then I will always help a new player.  Message me on Steam and I'll get you into my Discord and get you going.     Grab yourself a membership after some time and a weapon or two.  You'll get out pretty cheap and still have a great experience until the next time you need to buy a thing.

1429,12976,12980,Fallout Shelter,"The PC port of the idle/exploration/simulation fusion Fallout Shelter is a near ideal version of the mobile game, incorporating all the mobile game's expansions while adding a few other improvements of its own.  It fixes two of the biggest problems of the mobile version:1)  On mobile, you are effectively unable to control the camera.  On PC, WASD+Q/E control the camera and make it simple to get to exactly where you're going, rather than having to edge your phone's touchscreen to get it to the right point.2)  On mobile, you quickly have nowhere to go.  On PC, in addition to the Quest system, which you unlock shortly after you've got your vault self-sufficient, you have several rooms that allow you to craft items directly, which you unlock shortly after you've got your Quests underway, and at ratios that are more forgiving than the microtransaction-heavy mobile port.Curiously, this makes microtransactions even less attractive than usual - the same junk system that lets you craft gear also competes for storage space with your initial bequeathed weapons and armor, so microtransaction purchases could go to waste.

1437,4296,4300,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"Yu gi Oh duel links is a battle card game where you can duel with or aganist characters of the Yu gi oh anime show like Yami Yugi, Kabia, Joey and even Jaden from Yu gi oh GX. You can use monster cards, monster abilities, trap cards and spell cards to defeat your oppenent. This game also has great pvp where you can battle other players your level and level up as you win duels.You can also transfer your game data between devices through a konami account so you won't have to worry about starting over again. The music is enjoyable to listen to and the characters are voiced beautifully by the casts from the anime shows. However, some cons to the game is that there are gambling elements like using gems to get card packs and you may or may not get the card you want. You will also have to do some grinding to get gems which are required to get more cards and key which you need to duel other characters in the game not the pvp. You can use real world money to buy card packs so you can say that the game is sort of pay to win especially on pvp. Though the game does give you enough gems and keys as gifts when dueling enough or just for login in to the game without having to pay any real world money. You can earn gold to puchace special cards but you won't use gold that much because you can't use gold to buy card packs. Early in the game the NPCs are far too easy to duel and take a little too long to become more challenging. Also right now the game is not full screen and you can't make the screen any bigger.

It usually says that the average wait time is 2:55 but I've had some ques take up to 30 minutes with me giving up. I know the game is in Alpha and probably doesnt' have a huge amount of players at this point but it's still pretty boring just waiting in que. They did add a mini-game to mess around with while waiting which can help kill the time....As far as the gameplay goes....pretty badass! I've played in about 10 5v5 matches and everyone has been a blast. There are a good selection of ships, all with different abilities and different styles. I'm still pretty noobish at this point but look forward to trying the different ships. One thing that I think they should add to the game is a chat function while in the lobby. I have no way of seeing how many folks are sitting staring at the counter just like me and it would keep my in the game longer because I would have someone to chat and asks questions to.

This game used to be amazing, there was a point to building things, it was fun, you could build cool looking things and they would work if built properly, it was just a good idea for a game.   I loved it tbh.   Now comes the bad news....No tiers - You literally begin playing the game against people that are lvl 100+ and yes, you will die a lot.Energy System - forces you to build smaller robots to use most high end weapons, or build large robots with no damageRandom new weapons - They literally keep getting worse and more OP, if you have the tesla and invisibilty you can just drive around running over people and ruining matches for players who spent time building and designing things to play the game the way it was meant to be♥♥♥♥ MODS - They will literally ban you for talking in chat a lot, and heaven forbid you take the time to defend the game, because they won't see that, they'll just see some little f*cking b*stard child ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how you hurt their feelings, and ban you again♥♥♥♥ DEVS - Yes, i said that, they've literally been getting terrible reviews for months and they listen to what we have to say, and do the opposite.

They have no money, and terrible ideas, but we the people that actually buy premium and pay for games like this get ignored.

1449,8229,8233,Neverwinter,"A very fun game, absolutely worth the time you'll spend playing it. To top that off, it's FREE. And though you'll begin very slowly, giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows, the moment you expect a chore, you're fighting the Necromancer's chief in brute strength. From there, you can do anything you so choose, whether that be the plot line or discovering things you aren't supposed to yet.Every class and race feels individual, as some races change the loadout of your class. It runs off the familiar Stats from DnD, Strangth, Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution, & Wisdom. These stats will effect anything you do. This game requires skill rather than good equipment, unlike WoW, in that you can sidestep and teleport (depending on your class) to escape attacks. You have to have full situational awareness though, because if one enemy can sneak up on you, you're gonna have a bad time.You can quest with other people, which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than  other MMORPGs. There is even a mail system. And though some quests you do feel similar, you won't get bored of them. They never feel repetitive, although they sound like it.Bottom line is, if you have hard drive space, good internet, and NEED something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year, this game is definately for you.",1, fun game absolutely worth time spend playing free begin slowly giving soldiers medkits collecting broken arrows moment expect chore fighting necromancer chief brute strength choose plot line discovering things supposed class race feels individual races change loadout class runs familiar stats dnd strangth dexterity charisma constitution wisdom stats effect game requires skill good equipment unlike wow sidestep teleport depending class escape attacks situational awareness enemy sneak gon na bad time quest people fantastic makes game friendly mmorpgs mail system quests feel similar wo bored feel repetitive sound like line hard drive space good internet need occupied rest year game definately

No. There are other things which completely ruin experience, too.Menu design is super ugly, terrible, broken and confusing. Big wheel design is super idiotic console  thing. What this s.it is doing in pure PC game is beyond reason. It's one of the worst menu designs I ever saw! And my eyes are hurt every time I have to navigate in menu because of terrible font rendering.

While the game doesn't  manage to avoid the grinding issues Hearthstone has (primarily due to expensive, deck defining Legendaries), it's pretty generous with giving out free stuff in the form of gold and packs. The digital nature of the game is exploited wonderfully in mechanics that could never work in a physical card game like Magic, and ways that would probably be too complex for Hearthstone (which tended to use its digital nature mainly to produce RNG effects).Overall, Eternal is a great card game with a lot of competitive promise, though currently held back a little by the limited pool of cards available.

1491,5244,5248,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewIts a really great smash-like game that's more focused on reaction and counters rather than action and attack. I absolutly LOVE this game, but here are the characters that are ridiculously overused and how they normally play based on my experience in competitive and, to some extent, normal online.   1-Hattori: The sweatiest tryhard who will do 1000 attacks/second, throw every weapon off the stage so that you won't get it, will leave the second the match is over and will never treat it like a game.  2-Bodvar: Is generally fun to fight, but you just see a lot of Bodvars and 1 in 10 act like most people who play Hattori.  3-Ada: The character that will spam the same moves with guns and can be fun to fight when she has a spear.  4-Orion: The character that spams his side heavy and hardly does anything else.  5-Lucien: You don't see Lucien as much anymore. I don't have a lot of problems with him other than the amount of easy combos this guy can do and his seemingly high damage with very fast speed.I really love this game, but somethings need to change so that more characters get the spotlight, specially with how easily it is to combo with guns and how spamable the laces are. Still, this game is absolutely amazing, but a lot of the things I've mentioned are brainless and not fun to fight against.Two of the things I think the game needs:  1-1v1 matchmaking that doesn't affect the person's ranking. (Think the normal online mode, but just 1v1)  2-A weaponless mode.

Just don't forget to stock your explorers with enough Stims and Rad-aways and train them for long walks and fights. And plan your quests. Some of them will take more than 10 hours to get there. Send your troops out before you go to bed. The next day you can do the quest and send them back home (and if you found some Nuka-cola you can have them home in no time).

1516,4572,4576,SMITE®,"SMITE is a game with some nice character design and a unique perspective for a MOBA, and literally no other redeeming qualities. Everything bad will be bad forever. Their sense of balance is a trainwreck centered around Conquest (the basic MOBA mode, equivalent to Summoner's Rift in League of Legends) with zero regard for the two concievably-fun modes, or any others, though plenty of characters are unabashedly overpowered or horrible on Conquest, as well. Again, this will never change, unless it's for the worse.There is a continuous attempt to convince players to spend money on the game, with many of the cosmetics vanishing forever, often the ones requiring a massive toll of both time and money. Many more skins can only be obtained through chests, rather than bought directly, to extort more money from gambling addicts.HiRez should definitely hire an actual programmer at some point. Every single patch is a storm of broken UI functionality, disconnects from the server, and outright crashing.HiRez hates fun. They firmly segregate character classes, with magical and physical being the main division, and barring the one passive item, no one of these types is allowed to deal the other type. They also acknowledge, if anything at all from the community, the absolute worst suggestions made by the worst people, which brings me to my next point.The community is despicable. You haven't known hatred until you've experienced a Nox main on Arena. It may seem childish to wish someone actual real-life harm over a video game, but if any force on Earth can cause that to happen, it's SMITE. And Arena is an actually fun mode, despite having minions be too valuable. Conquest players hate you for not playing exactly how they want, and also hate you because they are terrible about the game they are yelling at you over. They only know one thing, and that is that they hate you, personally, and wish you the worst life has to offer, including being trapped in a game with them. Surrender is theoretically possible at 10 minutes (not early enough, but better than League's 20), but almost never passes.The matchmaking is analogous to a war crime. It appears to take the average ELOs of two handfuls of people, which means that, despite the asymmetrical reasoning this creates, you, specifically, get a team of people far below your skill level and must defeat a team only slightly below your skill level, which means you 1v5 against fed players.Of course, the company may have committed actual crimes, because employee reviews have painted its CEO to be a despicable, arrogant, 1% representative manchild who insists that balance is whatever he does well with.Play SMITE if you want to poison your soul so deeply that you feel contempt and betrayal even looking at a MOBA or a book on religion. Otherwise, try literally any other game, but still not League as it may actually be worse.

1543,2247,2250,Path of Exile,"Path of Exile has to be one of the most enjoyable RPG games ive played since Diablo 2. Lots of players will tell you, as will i, had you sunk countless hours into the diablo franchises and been ultimately disappointed by Diablo 3, this is the game for you. A player since open Beta, this game has come so far in terms of class expansion, level development, progression and the unique orb reward system which the games economy largely revolves around. The 3 month challenge leagues released by the developers keep this game new, exciting and fun, while simultaneously introducing new skill gems for awesome monster smashing, altering the passive tree to keep players builds dynamic and fresh (and to prevent face rolling, because lets face it, Path of Exile WILL kill you!) With 6 different classes to choose from and countless character builds, if you enjoy individualizing your character i strongly recommend this game! Overall, i rate Path of Exile 9/10Replay Value: -Countless HoursDifficulty: -Hardcore players beware !!! Casual players also be warned, you will lose 10% exp for every death! Economy: -With the introduction of customizable hideouts, trading is better, in need of a more dynamic and integrated trading system-Orbs are awesome! (double function as a mechanic to alter gear or trade up for better!) Cons-time investment is huge, i.e learning how the economy works, what can kill you (virtually everything if youre not paying attention 24/7)-mainstream builds do exist in both hardcore and standard leagues-limit to 'individualization,' but still doable! -Storyline is lacklustrePros-Itemization, monster synergy, skill effects, and passive tree designed in a unique and fresh way that challenges the way we think RPG's should be played! I could go on and on, but honestly, just download the game, look up a build online and give it a shot.

1547,13325,13329,Creativerse,"Well, as this game sits open on my desktop, I write this.  I was gifted this game from a friend in Brazil when you still had to pay $15 to get it, so he payed for it so that I could have it. Well, according to certain restrictions, I could never play it. That wasn't the developer's fault. But when they made the game free-to-play on Steam, I felt kind of bad that my friend payed for it and I couldn't play it. That was a redundant story, but it's how I got where I am. The game constantly popped up in my recommended list and today, I finally decided, I will try this game. It has good reviews, and I mean, it was free after all. Installation was very quick, but it all fell apart after that. I opened the game for the first time, and I had to enter my date of birth to accept the Eula a total of 23 times. (yes I counted) It never ended up working, so I closed the game to restart it, seeing if that fixed my problem. Well, that did fix my problem. It brought me directly to what I assume is the main page. However, even though the game says singleplayer on the steam store  page, it wouldnt let me do anything from the main menu. I was brought to the FAQ and changelogs, and the X button closed my screen. I tried clicking the 'Free Recipe' button several times, but all it did was shake, rattle, vibrate, and intimidate me with failure. I closed the came once more to attmept to restart, and i got the same problem. I took my time to move my window around the screen in order to read the rest of what was scrawled at the bottom of the window, as the game launched with some strange resolution that was blocked by my window's overlay. And where I was getting at before, with 'the stem store says it has singleplayer', it said the creativerse servers were down and I could not play. So I closed the game and went and did something else for about 10 minutes. I returned and said third time is the charm, so I opened the game. This time, it approached me with the EULA agreement once more. I filled out my info and it drug me to character creation, and after a long drawn out process to start, I eventually was able to start to enjoy the game. And honestly, despite the bad first impressions, the insanely LOUD audio, and the strange resolution, the game is pretty nice, once you figure out how to fix those problems.",1, game sits open desktop write gifted game friend brazil pay payed according certain restrictions play developer fault game free play steam felt kind bad friend payed play redundant story got game constantly popped recommended list today finally decided try game good reviews mean free installation quick fell apart opened game time enter date birth accept eula total times yes counted ended working closed game restart seeing fixed problem fix problem brought directly assume main page game says singleplayer steam store page nt let main menu brought faq changelogs x button closed screen tried clicking free recipe button times shake rattle vibrate intimidate failure closed came attmept restart got problem took time window screen order read rest scrawled window game launched strange resolution blocked window overlay getting stem store says singleplayer said creativerse servers play closed game went minutes returned said time charm opened game time approached eula agreement filled info drug character creation long drawn process start eventually able start enjoy game honestly despite bad impressions insanely loud audio strange resolution game pretty nice figure fix problems

At first the learning curve is steap but once you get the basic hang of the game you fall in love with it. Probably the hardest part of the game is communication for new players since there are so many controls to keep track of that communication doesnt really mater that much with fellow faction members. But you may ask why does communication not matter. Because people in this game get hints. all you need to start a major online battle is one sunder (basically a mobil spawn site) and a border zone. once a battle begins your faction either gets pushed back to their nerest facility or you charge your enemy to their death WHICH IS EASILY THE BEST FEELING IN THE WHOLE GAME. expecially when you get pushed back to your nearest facility and all your faction team mates combine forces to, in one giant push, destroy the enemy and chase them.

1553,1151,1154,Fractured Space,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI have played this game A LOT.And it is a very good one in my opinion.I don't get all the hate lately. Most of it is due to angry kids, not getting everything at once for free or confusing facts.Pros:- Real money only buys you exclusive cosmetics in this game. EVERYTHING else is achieveable with ingame money. I didn't spend a dollar on this game for progress. Real money also buys:: Boosters (they will double your XP or Credits after one round. But you can get them through rng drop pods after playing a couple of games): You could buy a ship with Platinum (real money  currency) instead of credits. BUT it would be expensive and you also have to pay with XP for the ship, which isn't buyable with real money. So most likely you have enough credits after getting enough XP for one ship.IT ISN'T PAY TO WIN!- Higher tier ships aren't better than the starter ships. In fact the starter ships are very powerful. The higher tier is just more complex to play and imho more fun. They try to balance every ship the same. So you don't need the most expensive ship to win.- Every ship has it's own style to play with. So it is very different and brings a lot of depth to the game.  - You can't win this game on your own. You have to play as a team and you have to communicate. If you don't do that you are doomed and more experienced players will turn from helpful to salty. So if you are new and you red this: Please play as a team and have an eye out for your mates. Let people help you.- Graphics are good and there are a lot of visual improvements with most updates.- Long term fun.- You can play as a team up to 3 in public matches. Which will get raised when there are enough people to play against as a premade team. So it doesn't screw the balance too bad.- There is a shooting range so you can try any ship before grinding for it.- 2 game modes. Conquest that takes a little longer (25-50 minutes depending on the teams and balance). And Frontline, which is fast paced and gives you a random ship out of all ships and will provide a big battle arena (just one lane) in which you have to win in 12 minutes. After that it is sudden death.- People are in general friendly if you treat them the same. Even though the climate in the lower brackets seems to be a little more salty.- Devs are super responsive. They read the forums every day and provide as much help as possible and give answers directly. Also they are taking a lot of criticism and suggestions into the game to improve it for the community.Their balance is ongoing and when they messed something up they try to fix it fast.- There are monthly updates with a lot of content (new ships, new gameplay features, etc.)- It is free and no money grab. So why not play it guys?! Go get the game.Cons:- Small player base. Matchmaking takes up to 10 minutes in off peak hours. And then the balance is somewhat messed up, for experienced players have to play with new ones. Which isn't much fun for both sides.In peak hours it is more like 3 minutes. Which is OK.- The grind is very big. You need to play A LOT to unlock everything (which isn't really necessary, for there are no ""better ships"" in general). But it could be frustrating.- For the time being if a player disconnects you don't get a new team member. They have to reconnect to the match. Or else it would be 4 vs. 5.

1558,12999,13003,Fallout Shelter,"TL;DR - Don't spend money on this game, especially if you play on multiple devices, or care about your save data syncing correctly.Fallout Shelter is worth checking out for the first time, or returning to if you haven't played since it initially launched on mobile (lots of interesting new depth with crafting and quests).The fun just ended for me, though. Lost a week's worth of progress due to Steam Cloud Save shenanigans (booted up a laptop I'd left the game running on over a week ago). The game generates 1 backup save that I found after digging for a while, but it was overwritten before I realized what had happened. Lost over a week's worth of progress.Syncing is destructive with no regard for time spent in game.

1567,12363,12367,Bless Online,"Early Access Review(I apologize for the poor grammar.)I just refunded... and let me tell you why...(Note: I read the apology letter from the Exec Producer, was touched, but not convinced)1. Artifical Economy - Why are you capping min and max price ranges on items in the AH? I feel like this is a laaaaazzzy way of trying to stop botters and cheaters. Like come on now...2. Web browser AH - Why is the auction house a damn browser?!!?3. No end game content  - self explanatory, although the executive producer did mention something in his apology letter about all the real stuff will come in 1-2weeks?? well maybe you shouldnt have launched yet. Getting pushed back is better than this fiasco right now.4. Feeling like a MOBILE MMO GAME - So i played ""Crusaders of Light"" and it feel Bless online gave me the that exact feeling. except with better 2012 pc graphics.  Auto run to quests that auto run to you an area. then you are given a vague mistranslated detail on how to complete your quest.  5. Pay to win - Right now there is some pay for convenience aspect of the game going on such as using RL money to buy gems that give you teleportation to certain dungeons, etc. Nothing major but this just opens the door for more P2W stuff.6. Delay in combat - To be honest, I really like the combat.  It was fun trying to combo these spells together into creative spell chains.  BUT it was so clunky and felt delaaaaayeeeedddd... Whenever I would hit my stance conversion and try to cast a follow up spell, often the game was running so poorly that I would miss the follow up spell.  I would constanly spam and check for a confirmation but nope. I would just miss the spell completely.  Basically what I'm saying is the combat is NOT VERY SMOOTH. 7. Translation - What can I say... anything in the english language that has ""ag"" is censored.  You can say the most vulgar things, but you cannot say words like ""again"", ""bag"", ""lag"".  You cannot even type Neowiz out because it is censored.  Some of the spell translations are off too, so sometimes you just have to guess at what you are doing.8. Not so rewarding grinding - Anything that isn't combat related is boring as HELLLL!!!9. This one is a positive - I like the voice acting.10. This is more like some advice...

You control a capital ship in 3rd person, and each has a handful of abilities.

The game does not contain built-in voice communication so I suggest that you join the official Discord server to find players.

1599,15664,15669,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewI'll keep this review brief. I grew up with AdventureQuest; the nostalgia value is certainly here in abundance. The way it has been revisioned from a 2D, Microsoft Paint-esque visual to a full-scale 3D MMORPG is actually my favorite part about the game. There's a lot of good things about this game despite its early access state (open beta). There's also a lot that could be improved and even a few things that need to be scrapped. First: as a mobile game, it's actually awesome. Plays pretty well on my Nexus 6P - battery drain is surprisingly low and there are flexible graphics settings (could be improved). Combat and gameplay is fun on mobile, not as much on PC. The cross-platform does have its conveniences, though. Story is pretty standard AE. It doesn't blow your mind, but the humor is entertaining for some to most. A lot of the characters, particularly the ones who have had time over the years to be fleshed out and built around the AE staff they're based on are relatable and good characters overall. Didn't get too far into AQWorlds so I can't speak as to how well they write villains these days. From what I've seen in what the story offers currently, it's not so bad. One of the first characters I actually paid attention to and liked got killed immediately and is probably the only character that will happen to.It 100% needs a Book of Lore like what AQW has. It's hard even for veteran players to keep up on whether or not things are completed. Things are pretty ambiguous and the main story is a bit disjointed once you finish a zone. A Book of Lore would fix all of that and give the developers a guide for future content in relation to player progression and main story cohesion.Progression needs a lot of work. Classes have no depth beyond what abilities you immediately get when switching to them. For some, it's enough, but there's definitely room for more character choice and gameplay options here. Skill trees, ability upgrades, passives, etc. What I miss from other AE games that I don't get from this one is actually progressing in your class and earning ranks, titles, and abilities. I do hope they add it even if people will gripe about more things to grind. On that note, gear could use some work, too. For one, a character profile or equipment page. Inventory management, especially with equipment, is messy. It needs a page that shows each slot and any equipped cosmetic. Would be nice if that all didn't take up inventory space, too. Gear stats need more depth and relevance. I'd like personal player stats we can choose to upgrade like classic AQ. But equipment just providing basic Attack, Armor, Crit, Haste, Evasion, etc. is just boring. I get that they want people to just switch between classes at their discretion (it's a fine idea if implemented well) but this way is just too simple and takes away from player choice and meaningful gear grinding (if that's a thing).That goes into my last major critique which is the UI. On PC, some of the elements have weird scaling. On mobile, screen space is hard to manage in any game, but this one could use some work. The inventory is mostly a big mess and it would be nice if the chat window and health bar were located somewhere else, although I can understand how frustrating it must be. If any developers read this, I'd suggest having some UI options available for people as every mobile device is different. AQ3D's Kickstarter page nailed the main point: it's a game that has a lot of potential. It's not even close to living up to it, though that's not to say it's a bad game, just that it has so much room to grow. In a market completely oversaturated with copy-pasted Asian MMORPGs, especially on mobile, this could be the game that topples it all and I hope it is. I'd recommend personally if only because I've actually been really enjoying my time with it on my phone. I'm really excited to see what they add later on, especially if they took the time to gather feedback and update classes according to it. If you didn't grow up with AE, they are the type of developers to literally put themselves into their games (I've met their NPCs and actual characters dozens of times in-game), be transparent about their plans and shortcomings, and keep pushing out content.They seem to be spread a bit thin with how many games they have - it would be a tough call to pull the plug on older games, but I understand they're focusing heavily on AQ3D anyway. It's certainly far from a perfect game, even a great game, but it's a great time-killer on mobile and is like any AE game very social. Some of the negative reviews I've seen aren't totally fair. I'd just check it out on your phone if it seems interesting to you and make up your own mind, like I did. If you grew up with AQ, definitely try it out.I'll recommend this even in its rough, incomplete stage because while it is fun and succeeds in some ways, it has a long way to go and every bit of feedback helps AE and I know they factor it all in.",1, early access review brief grew adventurequest nostalgia value certainly abundance way revisioned microsoft paint esque visual scale mmorpg actually favorite game lot good things game despite early access state open beta lot improved things need scrapped mobile game actually awesome plays pretty nexus battery drain surprisingly low flexible graphics settings improved combat gameplay fun mobile pc cross platform conveniences story pretty standard ae blow mind humor entertaining lot characters particularly ones time years fleshed built ae staff based relatable good characters overall far aqworlds speak write villains days seen story offers currently bad characters actually paid attention liked got killed immediately probably character happen needs book lore like aqw hard veteran players things completed things pretty ambiguous main story bit disjointed finish zone book lore fix developers guide future content relation player progression main story cohesion progression needs lot work classes depth abilities immediately switching definitely room character choice gameplay options skill trees ability upgrades passives etc miss ae games actually progressing class earning ranks titles abilities hope add people gripe things grind note gear use work character profile equipment page inventory management especially equipment messy needs page shows slot equipped cosmetic nice inventory space gear stats need depth relevance like personal player stats choose upgrade like classic aq equipment providing basic attack armor crit haste evasion etc boring want people switch classes discretion fine idea implemented way simple takes away player choice meaningful gear grinding goes major critique ui pc elements weird scaling mobile screen space hard manage game use work inventory big mess nice chat window health bar located understand frustrating developers read suggest having ui options available people mobile device different kickstarter page nailed main point game lot potential close living bad game room grow market completely oversaturated copy pasted asian mmorpgs especially mobile game topples hope recommend personally actually enjoying time phone excited add later especially took time gather feedback update classes according grow ae type developers literally games met npcs actual characters dozens times game transparent plans shortcomings pushing content spread bit thin games tough pull plug older games understand focusing heavily certainly far perfect game great game great time killer mobile like ae game social negative reviews seen totally fair check phone interesting mind like grew aq definitely try recommend rough incomplete stage fun succeeds ways long way bit feedback helps ae know factor

It's like playing with a FOV of 35 at all times. On top of that combat tries to be unique but instead just feels unnatural. Pressing R to initiate combos is not industry standard but everything else in the combat is leading to a very clunky feeling. The whole press tilda (which is a very unnatural key) to switch stances feels off to0. Especially since it's not a new stance like defensive vs agressive but rather just abilities that should flow. You for example hit charge then have to wait until you can do real attacks so using your R combos is the only way to deal dmg until the lock on your other stance wears off. Then after explaining all of this the game REMOVES ALL OF IT that's right you go back to only having two abilities with no explanation as to how you got where you are or why you are there or why you suddenly can't use half of what you learned.

1620,4315,4319,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"This game is great, but it is so boring to the point where I was yawning while playing this game. The huge big flaw is that the early duels are way to easy! I have seen NO ONE (Exept for the Legendaries) PUT A CARD DOWN IN DEFENCE MODE OR PUT DOWN A SPELL OR TRAP CARD! If you go second in any battle you basicly win, if the game decides to give you monsters you can throw down and not just spell or traps.(yes that can actually happen. I lost twice do to that happening). Like I said its way to easy early on (don't know about later on), but when I fight 30 some different people (not PVP) I SHOULD NOT SEE THE SAME MONSTER OVER AND OVER JUST THROWN IN ATTACK POSITION! With complete lack of any, absolutly, none, not a sigle piece of the AI doing strategy. No Spells, No Traps, and no Defence. This makes almost half the spell and traps cards useless because you beat them so hard you dont even need spells or traps. (except pvp where spells and traps are REALLY important. Don't just do what the AI do.). This is basicly a battle in this game The AI throws down 1 card in attack position and thats it. Then its your turn to basicly steam roll the AI with actual good cards with traps and spells. Can I ask who thought that having ONLY 3 SPOTS TO PLACE YOU MONSTERS,TRAPS AND SPELLS ON THE FIELD!? This has no regard to strategy even against the Legendary duelist, beacuse they only rarely put down spells and traps. Even if they do that half the time they dont even use them so just keep attacking and you win. You can win even without tribute summons and fusion summons. Just use the lvl 4 and below and you can basicly beat almost every duelist (except for pvp which actually has you going against people that know how to play well.). PvP is so terrible as well. It's good, only if you can stay in a match to completion and not get disconnected and get counted as you lost the game, even though you didnt quit. Then the game kicks you out and you lose. Just how? In what world is this system even fair? The AI is pathetic and the only good duels are pvp if you can actually finish and not glitch out! This game is GOOD, all it needs is a AI update and change the feild so you can put down 5 monsters or 5 spells and traps, AND PUT IN AN ACTUAL SHUFFLE CODE SO WE DONT GET USELESS TRAPS AND SPELLS WHEN WE NEED LVL 4 AND UNDER MONSTERS! Plus the pvp fix so its not glithcy and you can't just drop out and lose. These things should be easy, to fix. Take the game F.E.A.R even after 13 years that game still has the best 1st person shotter AI. Show me a 1st person shooter game that has better AI than F.E.A.R. The point is if a 13 year old game still has better AI than every 1st person shooter, than this AI should be even better or at least as good, so they just dont throw one monster down in attack. Once that happens you win, they can NEVER get the control back. These make it so whoever goes second pretty much instantly wins do to the huge advanteges you get for going second. The player who goes first dosnt get to draw a card at the begining of the game and cant attack, but the second player gets to draw and attack. After the second player goes then the first player gets to draw. Which im hopeing I dont need to explain how stupid that is.

1625,14845,14850,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewCame back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that I no longer endorse this game. They had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (TL;DR alert) I've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why I don't play anymore. I used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. The removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.Originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. All of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). Exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. Shooting said weak spots and watching 75% of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. It was the highlight of the game. The second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.How did this change? The removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. This absolutely DESTROYED the enjoyment of the game for me. I regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below 15% health, and this was due to having 3 working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. Not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. The poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy 75% of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. Completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. It used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. I got destroyed all the time when I first started playing, but I did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about 6 kills per game (no respawns when I played)I honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but I HATE when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche.

1626,1791,1794,Dota 2,"So I wanted to give the game a fair shot and I enjoyed it for quite a while actually and then it kind of all went to hell in a flaming car while demons sprinkled acid in to my eyes. Let me just say that the idea behind Dota is fun and its mechanically a good, if sometimes very oddly janky, game and if it were just up to that it would be fun. But its not just that. I don't think I've seen more people take a game more seriously and turn on eachother in such a way that is so cringe inducingly sad until your team loses every lane and you're forced to turtle the rest of the game out. I've seen death threats, people insulting eachother's lives and it just makes me wonder why bother? Add onto that the fact that games go from bad to worse when mistakes lead to uphill battles that can't be clawed back from and games in which you will literally be stunned for eight seconds straight and god help you if you fall even a little bit behind then because you will then not want to be in the game.

1629,5243,5247,Brawlhalla,"Summary:Brawlhalla is a simplified version of the Smash and Brawl Mario games. It is clean and smooth, responsive and easy to learn. The graphics are enjoyable as is the music. To top it off there are all kinds of multiplyer modes, including local co-op and it also supports many controllers.The negatives unfortunately aren't many but they are quite obvious. Much like other games of its kind it suffers from spam abusers and characters that are easy to spam. The developer's  focus has turned over to making extra money with the use of more and more aesthetic items, all of which can ONLY be bought with real money.All of the legends are locked but there are weekly free rotations. My main complaint is that players, once having unlocked all the legends, have no use for gold. A gold to mammoth coin conversion method would be handy to allow others to be rewarded for their play time.Final Thoughts:The simplified version of Smash that is easy to learn, suffering from some smaller balancing issues in matchmaking but still extremely entertaining, especially if played locally with friends.

1650,10410,10414,theHunter Classic,"I feel like most of the negative reviews for the game come from people who expect it to be free; understandably, given that it is, in fact, listed as ""free"". The full reality is that this is a game that works like an old-timey MMORPG - you pay a fee to be able to enjoy it in full. The free version allows you to, well, demo it, mostly, though if what you want is to roam around a ginormous, gorgeous map with a rifle in hand and shoot some stuff, I feel like you might be satisfied with what you get anyway. Personally, I don't mind paying 10 bucks to enjoy a full version of what appears to be a perfectly functional, engaging multiplayer game. I used to pay that amount for a single month, but maybe that's just me being old. Having checked out the microtransactions as well, the prices really aren't too obscene (when accessed via Steam, anyway - the official page offers less savings, for whichever odd reason), and you can pretty much do without buying any of that, especially if you do end up getting a membership access which automatically grants you a set of clothes to get you through the tougher maps. The core system's in place, the environments are incredible, and the animals are believable and natural. Shooting, whether you prefer that to be with a bullet, an arrow or a digital camera, all seems to be in order too. That said, this isn't a shooting gallery. It's more in the line of a walking simulator, or a ""crouching through the forest"" simulator, so expect to do a fair bit of that. For me, that adds to the experience; for someone else, that's a gamebreaking flaw. But if you're an Old Person like I am and maybe enjoyed the Deer Hunters from the past, which also involved a lot of waiting.... waiting....... walking...... and..... waiting...... you'll definitely enjoy this one, too. And frankly, after testing it out, I'm prepared to say that this game is worth a full total of 40-50 bucks on all grounds that I usually judge my games by (content, playability, replay value, graphics), which so happens to be about the amount I expect to be paying for it in the long run.No real complaints here.

1651,3549,3552,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewThis is a review for the last 7 months as a whole coming from 700 hours+ on G-Arena and 60 on Steam. In this review I'll focus on 3rd Person, because that's the way it was originally intended and as such that's what I stick to. This game firstly is built on a great engine,  with solid shooting mechanics, no dsync nightmare, very generious loot tables and just an all around a polished and stable game. In the new Pioneer Servers, you have a choice between 3 different loadout that are unique and change the way you can approach certain engagements. The Hang-glider with limited backpack space but great to get across swaths of land and get on enemy rooftops. Oh yeah, and you can shoot an smg while gliding! Very Hand-yThe snowboard, with medium backpack space, great for speeding away to zones or down mountains. Also, you can pull sweet tricks off by holding jump key before a ramp life formation in the world. The third pack is a climbing kit, which you can use to scale mountains and also include a zip line motor attachment. You will find zip lines scattered across the map to traverse. It also has the largest backpack space avaliable. *hint, you can hold about 75 more wieght by equipping a bulletproof vest. *Each pack includes a weapon to give you a fighting chance if you spawn next to an enemy. Which Brings us to spawning in game; which is grid based- choose your location. This is a change from most Battle Royales by not using a parachute mechanic to pick your location. This, in my opinion if MUCH faster to get in games without the fuss of waiting to land. A very welcome inclusion!When spawning in, my friends and I have noticed in game lag for a few seconds. Nothing major, just everyone spawning in and the game catches up, but don't let that put you in dispair, because overall the game, I feel is VERY well optimized for a beta. Decent options in menus to customize controls and graphics, but don't expect alot of visual flair. It's serviceable, but not to 2018 quality expectations. I will take gameplay that is fluid over ray tracing level of eye candy any day though. The game plays as most battle royales with a few new twists to it, such as moving zones are governed by ice cold weather called the ""Ymir"" and will deal damage over time, to an increasing effect. It will cover your screen in ice, adding to the effect that your in an ice storm. Your guns will also have ice and snow on them, which is a nice attention to detail that I appriciate. The end game is where the meat of the game is. It's not AS stressful as 1v1 in pubg are sometimes, because this time you have a helicopter that will land in a designated area that will be marked on the map. 4 people can board, but that will rarely happen because it will be a snipers hotspot picking off enemies climbing the ladder to board the helicopter. Most of the end game rely's on your medkits to last you til you and the last people can't take anymore damage and try to board the heli. It's a cat and mouse game and is fun but often repetative because it's less skill and more on who looted more medkits and can wait out the Ymir the longest. Overall, It fits with the narrative that Tencent is pushing with this game. Which I feel is a nice change to the regualar BR fair. You will find bit of story scatter around the map that will tell you what people were doing at the time before having to leave. After spending the majority of this year playing this game, I can say it's my favorite battle royale. It's refreshing, it works, and has a bright future with devs that are ON THE BALL when it comes to pushing updates and features. Give it time, you'll be in for a good run with this game.

1657,4159,4163,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"""A negative review on Duel Links? From someone with 50 hours in the game on Steam alone, who has created a community guide and logged over 120 consecutive days in the past year on the mobile version? BLASPHEMY!""Yeah, I know, but let me explain myself before you crucify me.Duel Links isn't a bad game. In fact, it's a great game that I've loved playing and that I've enjoyed from day one. Despite the microtransactions and sometimes unforgiving meta, Duel Links has been arguably the best Yu-Gi-Oh! game ever made, and Konami has shown dedication to both supporting its players and to regularly updating the game with fresh and exciting content. As a whole, I applaud Konami and what they've managed to accomplish in the year since Duel Links' global release.This review isn't about the quality of the game, though; rather, it's about my personal experiences playing Duel Links religiously for a year and why I've decided to take a step back from the game going forward. Long story short? I think I've been addicted.I mean it when I said I've played this game religiously. That's the attitude that both the game and the community promote if you want to stay in the competitive scene and keep up with the constant barrage of new cards being added to the game. You are regularly encouraged to log on daily, spending a couple hours here and there to grind for XP and reach the max level with your duelists, which is the main way to earn the in game gem currency needed to buy more cards. You'll spend hours auto-dueling npcs while pretending you can focus on other tasks in between, when really your mind is preoccupied with how you'll soon have to queue up your next duel and how much longer it'll take you to reach the next level or stage.I got into this game because I loved Yu-Gi-Oh! as a kid, and the idea of a free to play mobile game that was regularly updated and supported felt exciting and nostalgic beyond words. But I never expected to spend almost every day of the past year playing this game, or logging in for over 120 days straight, or how I would soon make excuses to play Duel Links when hanging out with my friends or going on coffee dates or even when just relaxing on the couch with my girlfriend. When the game is always in reach, your phone always nearby, it becomes so easy to log on to check on the cooldown on standard duelists, or to find yourself playing yet another pvp duel. People around me starting complaining, saying I was on my phone all the time, but I insisted it wasn't a problem and that I was still present and engaged in the conversations that would go on around me, even if it wasn't fully the truth. At work, at school, at home, on the bus - I played everywhere, anywhere.But venturing onto the Duel Links subreddit a few weeks back, I discovered that I wasn't alone in struggling to balance my time spent on Duel Links with my everyday life and responsibilities. So many other people have had these issues and multiple threads have been created to try and seek help from other players who didn't even know they shared these problems. Duel Links had become more than a daily routine for me, and these posts were a wakeup call: I had a problem.I'm still kind of taken aback by the whole experience, and I'm not expecting everyone here to understand, but as someone who's played video games all their life, I never thought a game could have the kind of hold on me that Duel Links has. I felt compelled to open the game daily; I HAD to so that I would continue my log in streak, so that I could continue to earn more gems so that I could feel like I was keeping up with other players. I hesitate to use the word addicted, but my Duel Links habit had become downright unhealthy.Sunday was the first day in 123 that I did not log in to Duel Links. It was a normal, quiet afternoon. I went to Starbucks, lounged around the house, played Overwatch on my PS4. It wasn't until after midnight had passed that I realized I hadn't played Duel Links in 24 hours, and the understanding that my streak had ended and that I didn't have to log in every day anymore if I didn't want to was cathartic beyond words.I know that not everyone will experience Duel Links the same way, or the way that I have. I'm not going to stop playing altogether, either; I meant what I said about Duel Links being the best Yu-Gi-Oh! game on the market, and I've met some amazing people in the community that I've bonded with over our ridiculous shared love for a children's card game.But since you can't leave a neutral review on Steam, I have to give it a thumbs down, if just for the regret I feel knowing how much of the past year I spent glued to my phone. This isn't meant to discourage anyone from playing Duel Links, and as I've said, I highly recommend this game. But please, please be aware of how much time you spend on the game, and don't let it impact other areas of your life the way it impacted mine. It's okay to believe in the heart of the cards - just don't let them consume you.",0, negative review duel links hours game steam created community guide logged consecutive days past year mobile version know let explain crucify duel links bad game fact great game loved playing enjoyed day despite microtransactions unforgiving meta duel links arguably best yu gi oh game konami shown dedication supporting players regularly updating game fresh exciting content applaud konami managed accomplish year duel links global release review quality game personal experiences playing duel links religiously year decided step game going forward long story short think addicted mean said played game religiously attitude game community promote want stay competitive scene constant barrage new cards added game regularly encouraged log daily spending couple hours grind xp reach max level duelists main way earn game gem currency needed buy cards spend hours auto dueling npcs pretending focus tasks mind preoccupied soon queue duel longer reach level stage got game loved yu gi oh kid idea free play mobile game regularly updated supported felt exciting nostalgic words expected spend day past year playing game logging days straight soon excuses play duel links hanging friends going coffee dates relaxing couch girlfriend game reach phone nearby easy log check cooldown standard duelists find playing pvp duel people starting complaining saying phone time insisted problem present engaged conversations fully truth work school home bus played venturing duel links subreddit weeks discovered struggling balance time spent duel links everyday life responsibilities people issues multiple threads created try seek help players know shared problems duel links daily routine posts wakeup problem kind taken aback experience expecting understand played video games life thought game kind hold duel links felt compelled open game daily continue log streak continue earn gems feel like keeping players hesitate use word addicted duel links habit downright unhealthy sunday day log duel links normal quiet afternoon went starbucks lounged house played overwatch midnight passed realized played duel links hours understanding streak ended log day anymore want cathartic words know experience duel links way way going stop playing altogether meant said duel links best yu gi oh game market met amazing people community bonded ridiculous shared love children card game leave neutral review steam thumbs regret feel knowing past year spent glued phone meant discourage playing duel links said highly recommend game aware time spend game let impact areas life way impacted okay believe heart cards let consume

1661,12313,12317,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewI cannot believe how long I have been waiting and keeping an eye on this game. I've been waiting for a game that ticked my boxes, but sadly this isn't the one.The game looks good, has a huge map that's begging to be explored and I would've loved to explored it, combat is somewhat interesting and refreshing as well. Sadly this is all ruined by the fact that the Devs can't get a working game to peform correctly. The game has failed few times in the past, yet here we are. I got no clue of why they failed but what I do know is that if you fail, you learn from your mistakes. Here that doesn't seem to exist.Why bother throwing out packs that give customers access to the game 2 days early before official release date when the servers are wank, fps is shockingly poor and loading screen freezes??? Makes no sense at all. I honestly feel sorry for the game, fans and maybe devs but this isn't right. I'm thankful that Steam has refunded me my money as if they wouldn't, then this would've been a cashgrab.Not only that but a user made a thread regarding a duplication bug and it so happens to be the same one that existed in the previous versions of the game. I checked with Discord to see if this was true and one mod said that he or they were looking into it. Sounds like a yes to me.TL:DRDo yourself a favor and click  Not Interested  as this game is a complete mess.

The game plays the exact same way with some additional changes like festivals, air ports and World Tours. Instead of just making your opponents go bankrupt, there are 3 additional objectives. Own all the property on one side of the board, own 1 land of each colour or have the most value at the end of the game. The game will default end in 30 minutes.Gameplay-wise, you still roll the classic pair of dice for a roll and move mechanic. However, there is paid cheating here. For 3 coins, you can get to reroll your dice results. For 2 coins, you can choose to ensure both your dice are the same number. These coins can be paid for in cash. Whenever you land on a location, you can either buy the land and build houses on it or pay the rent and repurchase it from the current owner.Conclusion, skip this game. It's a Pay To Win clone of Monopoly. There is nothing new and the ability to use spend cash to buy coins to gain in-game advantages is just disgusting.

1689,6235,6239,Heroes & Generals,"Been playing this game a number of years so I speak with experience of yesterday and today. Prior to this review I checked the number of positive reviews (just over 50K) and the number of negative (just over 39K), I find myself in the middle but for the purpose of Steam I have ticked no. First of all please ignore the images on show, I don't think any player gets graphics like that, I have a pretty top rig with decent FPS and graphics on high and its nothing like the images above. Clearly they have had the Kim Kardashian effect of having been glossed.The only good thing about this game is that its a game that still has a lot of potential, yet the potential is never really realised. The Devs make far to many judgement errors when developing this game and I will list a number of them below.As a free game I do appreciate that development must be slow due to revenue streams being tight, but still I expect a certain bare minimal to let that stand, but now things are really sloppy.1: Give the people/community what they wantDid you know that LMGs didn't have bipods? Yep that right, all those movies and documentaries you have seen were the Germans mount MGs on the ground, or on concrete/sandbag bunkers were all fake. Well according to H&Gs there are. Even though they are drawn on the weapon you can't use them. Virtually every WW2 game I have ever played apart from the very early Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games from the early 2000s had deployable bipods. I think Day of Defeat may have been the first and that was a mod for the original Half life which gives you some idea of how long they have been used. On forums all I see is give me bipods, give me certain planes, and yet the devs say, not currently planned. When CoD WW2 came out all MGs were mountable, so how come the Devs of CoD included it even though MGs don't really play a huge part, were as MGs in H&Gs do? Makes no sense and especially hafter 3-4 years of asking too.2: Devs don't know their history sometimes.There is a wide variety of weapons and vehicles in this game and for the most part they actually do look great. But one of the most laughable things is when they introduced planes that never even featured in WW2. On the Generals map, you can attack Switzerland. Hang on were they not nutural in WW2? Russia can attack USA and vice versa, could have sworn they were allies.3: A cheater/hackers paradiseI never quite understand the need to hack, cheat, use macros etc in MMOs because ultimately it can kill of the the genuine player base. In spite of the devs best efforts this game is a hack fest, and it has become quiet the joke especially when you see some of the videos on YouTube. Recently I got headshot sniped by a pistol, the other player was on the other side of the map. This after the introduction of a major update which included new anti hack software. But like anything, go for the lowest bidder and you will get what you have paid for.4: Very angry player baseCompared to a few years ago, abuse has become aweful and this has nothing to do with bad players (although it is the individual player committing the abuse) its the way the devs have allowed players to play.There is really no way to learn this game any more except the hard way compared to years ago when there was a basic training map and a basic skirmish map. Now any player of any rank and experience can play any map and in a lot cases thats not fair for the new player and also not fair for the experienced player. In the basic maps that are supposed to be designed for novice players, its far too common now to come across players with high end gear. Flip the coin and you have similar issued playing a General/war game and find yourself under the command of a player who is lvl 4 and your lvl 15, it simply makes no sense. With this in mind you see a lot of abuse in game due to players with a lack of experience not playing as a team. A simple solution would be to add restrictions to the game play options.I still have hope for this game, and always like to return every now and then to see where the game is, but its painful sometimes to see its current state.",0, playing game number years speak experience yesterday today prior review checked number positive reviews k number negative k find middle purpose steam ticked ignore images think player gets graphics like pretty rig decent fps graphics high like images clearly kim kardashian effect having glossed good thing game game lot potential potential realised devs far judgement errors developing game list number free game appreciate development slow revenue streams tight expect certain bare minimal let stand things people community wantdid know lmgs bipods yep right movies documentaries seen germans mount mgs ground concrete sandbag bunkers fake according drawn weapon use virtually game played apart early medal honor duty games early deployable bipods think day defeat mod original half life gives idea long forums bipods certain planes devs currently planned cod came mgs mountable come devs cod included mgs play huge mgs makes sense especially hafter years asking devs know history wide variety weapons vehicles game actually look great laughable things introduced planes featured generals map attack switzerland hang nutural russia attack usa vice versa sworn cheater hackers paradisei understand need hack cheat use macros etc mmos ultimately kill genuine player base spite devs best efforts game hack fest quiet joke especially videos youtube recently got headshot sniped pistol player map introduction major update included new anti hack software like lowest bidder paid angry player basecompared years ago abuse aweful bad players individual player committing abuse way devs allowed players play way learn game hard way compared years ago basic training map basic skirmish map player rank experience play map lot cases s fair new player fair experienced player basic maps supposed designed novice players far common come players high end gear flip coin similar issued playing general war game find command player lvl lvl simply makes sense mind lot abuse game players lack experience playing team simple solution add restrictions game play options hope game like return game painful current state
1690,13103,13107,Fallout Shelter,"I knew this was just a conversion from the mobile application, therefore, my expectations for this game should have been low. It is impossible, however, not to feel some excitement when engaging with new material from the Fallout universe - and excitement walks hand-in-hand with high expectations. Fortunately, Fallout Shelter has, to a great extent, met those expectations. Why? This game is so simple to play, which makes it perilously addictive. Everything can be controlled with just the mouse. For instance, to assign vault dwellers to specific roles, you just drag and drop them to SPECIALised rooms. That’s right, the pun was intended. Your vault dwellers have the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, just like Fallout, and some of the rooms have a preferred S.P.E.C.I.A.L.s. The Science Lab required high Intelligence, for example. While it isn’t compulsory to adhere to the assigned S.P.E.C.I.A.L., doing-so will make you vault dweller very happy; and happiness, as you will find, is very important. The rooms of your vault, weapons and armour will be limited in the beginning, but your options quickly grow with the growth of your vault’s population, which can be increased in two ways: you can build a Radio Studio to attract dwellers from the Wasteland, or, in a more novel way, assign a male and female dweller to a Living Quarters, then sit-back, and let the amorous spectacle commence. Fortunately, for those sick-minded individuals out there, the game won’t let you force incest, or exile a pregnant dweller. As for the graphics, they are, of course, basic, but not repulsive or retro-feeling. In fact, the endearing Vault Boy cartoon-style pervades the game and makes each dweller quite endearing. The power armour suits, though, look a little compressed, and a little too comical.  The replay value of the game is somewhat limited, which, of course, is because Fallout Shelter was intended to be the launch-pad for Fallout 4. This is evident in the missions, which, after incorporating some witty dialogue in keeping with the Fallout universe, fail to vary and challenge the player: the management in combat is limited, the same half-a-dozen locations become dreary, and the enemies equally so. In short, the missions can become something to run in the background, in order to gain revenue, whilst being more attentive to another task in your Internet browser. Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, but only if you looking for a bit of light-hearted fun. The serious gaming, and long-term gaming, remains with Fallout 4, or for more avid Fallout fans, like myself, Fallout: New Vegas.

1699,5487,5491,World of Tanks Blitz,"This game is a mixed bag. This game does not bring any new innovation to this genere/game type. This game had so much potentional of being good but failed upon that. This game does not look anything that the thumbnail of this game suggested, it looked like more of a ""sci-fi tank genre"" in the thumbnail then modern. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying modern is bad, all I'm saying is, many other companies like ""War Gaming"" has already done this type of game and theirs is much better in terms of effects and whatnot. There's frankly nothing exciting or new here. I do understand that this is a BETA game, and I may change my review if the following changes:- More detailed maps--->better graphics (I don't mention on improving graphics in many reviews, because I get the target auidence that the company is trying to fullfill, but I believe the target auidence for this game are for those who want immersion and a better graphical experince. I understand that this is a free to play game, but on that same note, ""World of Tanks"" is also free to play with much better graphics.- Better physics--->I'm not sure what is off with the physics, but I do detect something is dull about it. I think the explosion of the projectiles upon impact needs improvement as well as mechnics of the tank itself.- Needs more gamemodes, not just elimination, the gamemodes are crazy fast; needs to be gamemodes where you can select what you wish to play *(Although I suspect that they will be adding this feature later on)- The 60FPS cap needs to be removed. I could not find such way to remove it in the settings tab. Let the users decide if they wish to have a 60FPS or not, I have a 140Hz monitor with dual 1080's in SLI, and I wanted to get above 60FPS, and I was not able to.- The above point is making me lead into my second point, they should support multiple GPU setups for those who have such luxary to do so. - I also notice those lines on the edges of objects (e.i tanks, boxes, battlefield decor, etc.)--this is a result of having limited graphical settings with no AA option. Please fix this too.- Give incentives to players who are not ""premium"" users (so all the free users.)--->let's not forget that the free users make up majority of this game, and there should be more incentives (WITHOUT making the premium feel uneeded, but have the less ""pay to win"" vibe going on.)If these are fixed, I may give the game a second go, but for now I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It is, however, a good time killer, I suppose, and that's what it'll ever be until they make more improvements which give players incentives to keep coming back and playing more.",0, game mixed bag game bring new innovation genere game type game potentional good failed game look thumbnail game suggested looked like sci fi tank genre thumbnail modern wrong saying modern bad saying companies like war gaming type game theirs better terms effects whatnot frankly exciting new understand beta game change review following detailed graphics mention improving graphics reviews target auidence company trying fullfill believe target auidence game want immersion better graphical experince understand free play game note world tanks free play better better sure physics detect dull think explosion projectiles impact needs improvement mechnics tank needs gamemodes elimination gamemodes crazy fast needs gamemodes select wish play suspect adding feature later cap needs removed find way remove settings tab let users decide wish monitor dual sli wanted able point making lead second point support multiple gpu setups luxary notice lines edges objects tanks boxes battlefield decor result having limited graphical settings aa option fix incentives players premium users free forget free users majority game incentives making premium feel uneeded pay win vibe going fixed game second recommend game current state good time killer suppose improvements players incentives coming playing

1705,8,8,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,"Somewhere between light hearted, happy parody and being afraid of the dark lies Spooky's House of Jump Scares. You are tasked with the daunting duty of surviving one thousand rooms in this endless first person perspective runner. Each room is no more than a few seconds thanks to a sprint key and the fact that each door counts as a new room. Even then one thousand rooms is still a feat against tedium and needless repetition. There are still things every fifteen or so rooms to keep your interest and at the end of fifty rooms you'll find a save point, but nothing can save you from permanent death at the hands of the foul creatures that live within.On the surface the game has a clean, chipper almost cartoon low budget charm to it. Jump scares are rare and at first it comes in the form of adorable cardboard cutouts of pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons that pop out of the wall accompanied by a sound. Some of the sounds are silly and unfitting other times its screeches to drive chills down your spine. The game excels in the sound department and makes good use of music, ambient sounds and foot steps following you.As you delve deeper through the doors of this dank dungeon, you'll uncover more frightening things and points of intreege. There are plenty of written notes here and there. A few times you'll need to search for a key in a different room, but the other ninety-nine percent of the game is leaving rooms behind forever.The themes of the rooms begin to change from the mundane almost Wolfenstien 3D-esque corridors to metal asylum rooms that give you a flashlight to find your way through. There are purple dungeons, green sewers with glowing scum. Some rooms are coated with slime to slow you own while others have holes in the ceiling as if to give you a feeling of dread that something could pop out.There are a limited amount of rooms and I started to memorize them all. Even the game's crescendo encounters in a vacant room with walkways. There's no way to fall into the dark chasms, it acts as if they were walls, but with this open room you get to see a specific creature that might be following you. Sometimes they can float over the gaps, other times they're stuck trying to walk at you from across the gap so you can get a good look at them when they're harmless.If they touch you three or so times you're dead. You have health that does replenish over time and these big moments are rare and easy to avoid. Just keep running and hope there are no locked doors! They only happen in specific rooms and sometimes the rooms are empty, but it still gives that dreadful feeling.You can tear through these rooms pretty quick about 350 of them in a 45 minute. Your stamina will deplete to give a monster the chance to catch you, but going through a door restores your will to run. Other than that waiting a few seconds will replenish your stamina. Longer rooms hav1e limited visibility. The further out an area is the darker it gets.A few rooms have good diversions or tricks to them. Such as one that turns bright and you need to enter the correct combination of corridors signaled by chimes until you can see the door. Another room is endless darkness with a torch at the end, until its revealed that the torch is merely painted on a black wall. A few times you'll need to search an adjacent room for a key to the one you're in.Every fifty rooms, you take a moment to unwind in an elevator that reminds you to hang in there or have a coffee break. The game makes a good balance of calm moments for each of the few tense situations. Its what keeps you off kilter and never expecting anything. Every two hundred and fifty rooms offers a prize to you. What's in the box? Is it snakes? Is it a jack-in-the-box or is it a note?Truth be told I'm very goal oriented with video games and so Spooky missed its mark for me. The cardboard cutouts get in the way. Being chased by something means that it was no threat since it was already behind me. Perhaps in later rooms it gets more difficult, but this is just easy tedium.  Another room, another room, another room. Then knowing I have seven hundred more rooms and another two hour investment of endless running turns the game into a grind. There's no fear and its too long to endure even with save points. The game reuses its points of interest a few times since it recycles rooms.Another issue I have with the game is getting stuck on edges where I need to push away from a wall to get free and turn a corner. Its more than walls, its on the gaps too. I suppose this is acceptable for a scary game where you get chased, but I'm hung up on these hang ups.One interesting thing the game does have is a stabbing mini game where it looks like you're a ghost in a mall. Its a good diversion from the repetition. There's even a computer that shows you all the creatures in the house. Well most of them at least.The best selling point this game has is that its free. By no means does that make this a good game, but it makes it easier to accept. Its a game that brings you up with charm to tear you down with scares beyond the cheap cardboard cutouts that can litter a hallway every so often. Its just far too repetitive without that much dread or excitement.",0, light hearted happy parody afraid dark lies spooky house jump scares tasked daunting duty surviving thousand rooms endless person perspective runner room seconds thanks sprint key fact door counts new room thousand rooms feat tedium needless repetition things rooms interest end rooms find save point save permanent death hands foul creatures live surface game clean chipper cartoon low budget charm jump scares rare comes form adorable cardboard cutouts pumpkins ghosts skeletons pop wall accompanied sound sounds silly unfitting times screeches drive chills spine game excels sound department makes good use music ambient sounds foot steps following delve deeper doors dank dungeon uncover frightening things points intreege plenty written notes times need search key different room ninety percent game leaving rooms forever themes rooms begin change mundane wolfenstien esque corridors metal asylum rooms flashlight find way purple dungeons green sewers glowing scum rooms coated slime slow holes ceiling feeling dread pop limited rooms started memorize game crescendo encounters vacant room walkways way fall dark chasms acts walls open room specific creature following float gaps times stuck trying walk gap good look harmless touch times dead health replenish time big moments rare easy avoid running hope locked doors happen specific rooms rooms gives dreadful feeling tear rooms pretty quick minute stamina deplete monster chance catch going door restores run waiting seconds replenish stamina longer rooms limited visibility area darker gets rooms good diversions tricks turns bright need enter correct combination corridors signaled chimes door room endless darkness torch end revealed torch merely painted black wall times need search adjacent room key rooms moment unwind elevator reminds hang coffee break game makes good balance calm moments tense situations keeps kilter expecting rooms offers prize box snakes jack box told goal oriented video games spooky missed mark cardboard cutouts way chased means threat later rooms gets difficult easy tedium room room room knowing seven rooms hour investment endless running turns game grind fear long endure save points game reuses points interest times recycles rooms issue game getting stuck edges need push away wall free turn corner walls gaps suppose acceptable scary game chased hung hang ups interesting thing game stabbing mini game looks like ghost mall good diversion repetition computer shows creatures house best selling point game free means good game makes easier accept game brings charm tear scares cheap cardboard cutouts litter hallway far repetitive dread excitement

1709,1152,1155,Fractured Space,Played since November of last year. The game is great for all but one aspect. Graphics great. Gameplay not bad (or used to be not bad). The BOT AI is really nothing but cheat code. No real AI at all. And it just gets worse and worse. I have not seen one single team win a game in days now. None. They have repeatedly been asked to hire a DEV to write a real BOT AI but refuse to listen.  The game is now unplayable. Want proof? Over 6k members but only around 100 a day now. Does that tell you anything?  And a real shame. I really loved this game and spent a fair amount of money supporting it. I own all the ships in the game. I want (ed) the game to succeed. But I doubt that is going to happen now. I can't believe they would trash their own game over one DEV (BOT AI DEV) when the rest are doing such a great job. Sorry to see this happen.

1710,10126,10130,theHunter Classic,"Free to try.But: Every weeks there are two more free species to hunt above the White Tail, European Rabbit and the Pheasant.Basically, you have everything to hunt anything excepting the Bison. The .243 rifle is good against smaller deers, foxes, wolf, coyote, bobcat, ibex, goats and sheeps. Everything else can be hunt with the free single shot shotgun by using different shell types.There are competitions for non members where they can earn em$(ingame premium currency) and they can use that to buy weapons, licenses, callers, clothing etc. Honestly, you dont need or have to spend a single cent to play through this game even for years long.Memberships are not too expensives. There are some fair deals like the Deer Hunter membership, that gives everything that you need for deer hunting and you can use all things even after your membership is expired. I know, above the .243 and the basic shotgun ammunition, nothing is replenishing for free. But there are still missions that gives gm$(normal ingame currency) that the players can use for buying ammo, equipment and even licenses. Also, there are events, where everyone can win cool prizes without memberships. So, its free to play too. I personally have many friends in this game who does not have membership or earn that by doing competitions and missions.I think, most people who first visit theHunter, are waiting for some easy, arcadish hunting. But this game is far away from easy and arcadish.There are multiplayer servers from all across the World, where non members can play and learn. Most of us gladly helps any newbies if that people have the very minimum ability to learn the basics. And that is free, just have to ask for it.theHunter Classic is a good game, if you can accept the fact, this is most likely a simulator and not a simple shooter.If you dont fear to try out, ask for help on servers, add an email adress or change it in the launcher-account settings(you will get 3 days Journeyman membership and some cool stuffs.) Also, if you're using the Friend referal system for registering, you will get 200em$ for start and some other things. So, you can play the game  as member, with the ability to hunt everything(excepting the Bison).And a tip: if you're planning to spend some money(but not gazillions) on the game, get one .300 bolt action rifle(any) and the Boone & Crockett clothing set. You can get it for normal price or you can get it discounted time to time, but you dont have to pay more than ~10€ while you will be able to hunt everything later with the best camouflage against all deers. Callers are not really needed basically, you have your tracing skill and the Huntermate for help.I am not defending EW or Avalanche, this is the only game that they was able to release as a playable and enjoyable game.Try out, its free.

1711,939,942,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewI was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):My opinion: Solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. Only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad.  If played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. If you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. The devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game.  The negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. But really my negatives are limited to that and I do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions.  I suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards Sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. But when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. A lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. If anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so I find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. Additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. If i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what I see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. This isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. Of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect.  Since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.Microtransactions: Limited to skins essentially, you CAN'T simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. There is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. Every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1, early access reviewi going breakdown game wo nt bother simple longer opinion solid gameplay game breaking issues ve come weird issues matchmaking frequent bad played organized group game excel fun playing solo people point free weekend special posting sale remotely interested game devs shown develop decent game negatives fact game developed needs variety gameplay maps negatives limited believe devs shown interest properly developing game adding additions suppose second lesser negative directed sci fi junkies observe ships face value fine read details add things like crew cool arbituarily lot ships looks like sheets metal housing bare bones weapon infrastructure inside appear remotely controlled behemoths actually appearing thinly defended said sheets metal find difficult exactly crew ships live operate additionally physics ship movement nt add graphically displayed use thrusters upwards stop passively levels ship nose ship going thrusters nose clearly pushing main thrusters ship giving forward momentum stopping movement evening thrusters ship trying ship nt correct gravity ship evens thrusters visibily attempting level ship course try derail critique use leveling upwards fact space know mean graphics incorrect scifi junkies likely ones immersed kind game important aspects correct microtransactions limited skins essentially simply buy ship unlock use little detail provide regard wo nt bother know microtransactions heavily limited wo nt people money winning ship pros cons like means best

1717,16627,16632,Bloons TD Battles,"The game in general is really fun, and it captures the spirit of bloons wonderfully.Unfortunately it's overshadowed by the absolute terrible balancing the game has.The game has two main modes, attack mode or defense mode. Attack mode allows you to send bloons at your foe for money, and you will receive increased money per turn. Defense mode is just you going head to head with someone without sending the bloons.Attack Mode is probably most popular, and the best mode in my opinion. It's really great to select your towers for the game and plan out what you'll do, and send certain bloons at your enemy depending on the towers they have.You can only choose 3 types of bloons, and you can get a random one for ""energy"", this isn't too bad, but it does often feel like you don't quite have enough bloons to cover all your bases.There are two big issues in my eyes with attack mode. It's simply too easy to place one or two towers that can deal with the easy bloons at the start, and save up the large amount of money to get the massive red blimp. Since this would still be relatively close to the start of the game, there's no way you can defend against this and it's normally a gameover.It's not always even a red bloon, people can just flood you with a ton of bloons or even just higher level bloons. You can defend against this more or less, but depending on your setup it can easily overwhelm you. This also leads to having to be very specific you have bloons to defend against these, since you're only allowed 3 - 4 towers.The next big issue I see with attack mode is directly from the game. Once you get to around round 32 they start sending an insane amount of powerful bloons at you. This wouldn't be a problem if you actually had the finances, map space, or upgrades to actually deal with them; but more often than not you just don't.Defense mode is just laughable. In attack mode you start off with making $250 after some amount of seconds; defense mode only gives you $70 to start with. That wouldn't be a problem if they adjusted the tower cost or the bloon difficulty. But it's exactly the same patterns as attack mode. There are far too many bloons for the speed at which you can upgrade your bloons. You can buy money-per-turn upgrades, but the lowest tier gives you an extra $2 per turn for $50. That's a crazy amount of money when you're only getting $70 each time.Besides the two game modes there are lots of different events, some of which are pay-to-play. They allow you to play special events once per day, or you can get a membership to play it all the time. You also do not have access to all towers and tower upgrades at the start. You unlock the ability to purchase them by winning games; you purchase them with coins in game which you can get either by paying with real money or various random methods in game.This game is super great for playing with friends, though unless you play against random people you won't have any towers or upgrades aside from the base ones you start out with.It's just super frustrating to play, mainly because of the terrible balancing. It's free, so I'd recommend trying it out for yourself and see what you think; but as a good game I cannot really recommend it.",0, game general fun captures spirit bloons wonderfully unfortunately overshadowed absolute terrible balancing game game main modes attack mode defense mode attack mode allows send bloons foe money receive increased money turn defense mode going head head sending bloons attack mode probably popular best mode opinion great select towers game plan send certain bloons enemy depending towers choose types bloons random energy bad feel like bloons cover bases big issues eyes attack mode simply easy place towers deal easy bloons start save large money massive red blimp relatively close start game way defend normally gameover red bloon people flood ton bloons higher level bloons defend depending setup easily overwhelm leads having specific bloons defend allowed towers big issue attack mode directly game round start sending insane powerful bloons problem actually finances map space upgrades actually deal defense mode laughable attack mode start making seconds defense mode gives start problem adjusted tower cost bloon difficulty exactly patterns attack mode far bloons speed upgrade bloons buy money turn upgrades lowest tier gives extra turn crazy money getting time game modes lots different events pay play allow play special events day membership play time access towers tower upgrades start unlock ability purchase winning games purchase coins game paying real money random methods game game super great playing friends play random people wo towers upgrades aside base ones start super frustrating play mainly terrible balancing free recommend trying think good game recommend

It is also a fact that I hate F2P games, for it is often it is P2W.Don't let Steam's Game Time fool ya'll. I've played this game since Nov 2013, daily. I got the game directly off SOE's page. When I first tried it, I felt confused in a good way, and It was fun. 100's of People on foot, in Tanks, In Transport Trucks ""Called Sunderers"", And in fighters.                                                                                                                                         Then after 2-3 Months, I felt like I was repeating yesterday, over and over. The first impressions the game left on me vanished. I decided to stay, however, seeing I invested time, and money.

It's quite obvious that wargaming wants your money, nearly all game developers wants money, but it shouldn't be this extreme (I know it's not that extreme but as of the looks of it it will become VERY extreem indeed). The game also needs alot, and I mean alot of work on the matchmaking. The tiers are very good indeed but when it comes to tank types it needs heavy work. It's not fun coming in a game with only lights on your team and the enemy is only heavys and tds for example.

There aren't, to my knowledge, extraneous skill mods like XVM so it's less competitive and you are able to relax more. I was given 1300 gold and 4 days of premium just for starting the game which is a huge boost and makes it easier to play and learn. This game is relaxing compared to WoT and I don't have as much commitment or salt as a result (so it's quite fun to play).7 v 7 tank combat, unlike any fps around. Tanks have varying levels of penetration, damage, and armor (as well as many more nuances) that change how they are supposed to fight. You need to either kill all 7 enemies or cap their base to win the battle. Battles last on average about 5 minutes, but it could be more or less depending on your team and if people try to camp/hide. There are over 400 tanks in the actual World of Tanks, and Blitz has a couple hundred as well (I'm not sure how varied it is, but there are some differences). You have loads of tank styles to try and it's hard NOT to find something you like to play.TL;DR: Relaxing and lower skill floor compared to the full/actual World of Tanks game, much less demanding on PC resources, fun 7 v 7 PVP tank shooter.

1745,2146,2149,Path of Exile,"So i see it's not enough for a review to say the game is good, when it clearly is. But i will ellaborate my thought.So this game is my day to day grinding simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music. Since i'm not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo has kinda outlived it's era and passed on, to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame.I'm not comparing this game to diablo in anyway, and thats why i think it's good, it is another game.It has a lot of interesting very well made lore, tons of spells attacks and different ways to defend yourself, using all kinds of gems, that can freely be socket in and out of it's colour matched socket in your armor or weapon.The game has a certain difficulty, it's not a beginner frendly game in itself, it has a good introduction to wreaclast. But it's the community that makes that part great, theres tons of guides and videos on how to play the game, i myself have watched the streamer and youtuber ziggyD to get a feeling for patches and new items.the above have been almost only positive. But Path of exile have some downsides, and not just two but a bunch.A few big to mention are:the constant unsteadyness in the server. You will never know when the server suddenly decides to spike out, and there have been period where the lag have been almost character destroying ;) But it seems to have gotten alot better.It's repetetive, like there are 4 acts with different areas and a tons of different maps. But it all boil down to running from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master missions.The rng, if you arn't used to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can't take it when you lose, then this game is probably not for you, since it's system, thought it is possible to find out what areas to grind for certain items, it's 50% chance, a big part of the game is skill based , but if don't get the items you need your not gonna get far and almost everytime, give up on the character to start a new and see if that goes better or if some better items will drop. ofcourse on counter to that, there is a market for trading, so if you got coin community got ware.7/10for being the best grinding game for listing to music :D Love",1, review game good clearly ellaborate thought game day day grinding simulator wanna chill listen sweet music big fan diablo diablo kinda outlived era passed forgotten forgotens hall fame comparing game diablo s think good game lot interesting lore tons spells attacks different ways defend kinds gems freely socket colour matched socket armor weapon game certain difficulty beginner frendly game good introduction wreaclast community makes great s tons guides videos play game watched streamer youtuber ziggyd feeling patches new positive path exile downsides bunch big mention constant unsteadyness server know server suddenly decides spike period lag character destroying gotten alot better repetetive like acts different areas tons different maps boil running end killing way little sidequesting master missions rng way bad luck lose game probably system thought possible find areas grind certain items chance big game skill based items need gon na far everytime character start new goes better better items drop ofcourse counter market trading got coin community got best grinding game listing music love

As my play time indicates I'm somewhat into this game (and it doesn't even include mobile time)!While it doesn't have as much depth/interaction as Magic (as if any game even comes close) the mechanics it chose to remove ended up being a very smart move for a digital game.  Removing the excessive places to cast spells makes this game play so smoothly.And the mechanics of this game FINALLY embrace the digital platform in ways other games failed.  Graveyard mechanics, cards that remember their buffs even when put back in the deck, not having to reveal your entire hand when your opponent is looking for only units to discard.

1759,2960,2963,War Thunder,"Currently the game is no longer fun. Gaijin is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the entire community (unless your russian) and only see's us for the money in our wallet. We have been bring up, pointing out, and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse. The only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they 'might' pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel. However this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel. Oh, by the way, they are under a NDA which makes them completely worthless to begin with. An obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from Gaijins part. The T-34-85 for example very rarely catches fire, explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly, and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank. There was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a 1.0 spread between vehicles to .7. so for example tiger II's dont have to fight tanks from the korean war. Last i checked the poll was at about 3,100 for yes and ~30 for no. Gaijin has offically stated they will not change the BR system and that it is perfectly fine. Despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree.If you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier 3 is playing russian vehicles. Also on a observasional note, the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations. Just saying, they seem to be paying more attention to (a) certain nation than others.As the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste you'r money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian.

1764,1261,1264,Fractured Space,"Fractured Space has evolved rapidly over the last year, and thanbkfully the developers have eliminated nearly all of the glitches and failed connection issues in the matchmakeing system. The game mechanics are well balanced and it runs great on most mid level PC platforms. The controlls and strategy have been made easy to grasp for beginners, but remain complicated ehough that hardcore guys can get invested in them.PROS: Fractured space was a qnigue concept at the time of its early access launch. The orbital science fiction elemests and arcade phisics esssentally add a Z axis to what would otherwise be a naval combat game. The simplicity of naval combat simulators have incressed recent and Fractured Space's initial idea is appearing on other games like World of Warships. That said its still an uncommon idea that adds a waft of fresh air to the steam market.The typical initial learning curve is about an hour, and the system matches you with bots in initial multiplayer matches so that you can practice, gradually introducing live players who match your skill untill you become compeditive. The typical match is about twenty minutes, but there are no cutoff timers so two good teams can go at it for a ling time, with the longest match I have ever played lasting just over thirty minues.CONS: There is no single player campign, plot, or story, to contectualize events in this game at all. Something it would greatly benifit from given that crew characters with names and faces have been thought of. Alongside a lor of concept are that is included in the interface that shows a lively world that we really dont see any of. This is clearly a world that could easily have these elements, but I have heard no mention of them anywhere.The turd in the carpet for me has always been microtransaction systems because they are manipulative and nearly always result in games that require rediculus and protracted economics in order to unlock everything. These games almost always have random number slot machine dynamics that keep you from only buying the things you want, and these games are in a near constant fight between the non paying playerbase that demans balance, and the paying playerbase that demands a good reason to pay for extras.Fractured Space shows signs of this fight in its game store in that you have two entirely different kinds of objects for sale, Skins and Modifiers. Skins are cosmetic changes to how a ship looks, and modifiers are crew, implants, or boosters which change how a ship performs in a given match. You get a starter crew, but no implants, which means that players who pay for implants early on have a performance advantage over players who dont. Crews and implants can be earned over time, but a long long long time. Having bought into this early I have about half of the crews needed. As I have played, new implementations of the game economy have gradually increased the amount of time between crew unlocks dramaticly. The problem is that the effect crew and implants have is minor, to the point that an attentive free player could theoritically outmaneuver or out strategize a pay player. Which makes the varous packs they offer kind of mute, even when they have been on sale I struggle to find a reason to buy them because I cant controll what implants I get in the dedicated packs, and crew pods can give out the same crew over and over, in which case the crew gets autotraded for DNA, one of the three available in game currencies. Its designed to make it exponentally more difficult to unlock the last half of the available crew options.I can recommend Fractured Space overall, but new players should understand that they are jumping onto a treadmeal that seems to get longer with ever update, one which has alienated me as an older 90's era gamer, and one which the younger generation seems all to eager to accept as ""just the way it is"". I still play and I still have fun playing, but I get irritated every time I finish a match and get awarderd what little earnings each match gives me as a vanguard player.It takes over a month of frugal in game currency saving to afford the largest implant or crewpod pack in game for free. The thought of that, alongisde the constant reminders of how you could just buy platnum and get it now almost mocks me, because the economy is made so that you have to buy platnum in tiers that the random content packs all fall between, so you have to buy more platnum than you actually need in order to buy the packs themselves.If developers what to have microtransactions fine, but please have an ""unlock everything option"" available so that people like me know exactly what the maximum possible spending amount is and can choose to skip all the randum number BS.Also, just let me spend real money off my credit card for exactly what I want to get in the game. If I want to gamble, I'll drive an hour down to Las Vegas and hit the slots, at least then I have a chance, however reomte, to walk away with actual money.",1, fractured space evolved rapidly year thanbkfully developers eliminated nearly glitches failed connection issues matchmakeing system game mechanics balanced runs great mid level pc platforms controlls strategy easy grasp beginners remain complicated ehough hardcore guys invested pros fractured space qnigue concept time early access launch orbital science fiction elemests arcade phisics esssentally add z axis naval combat game simplicity naval combat simulators incressed recent fractured space initial idea appearing games like world warships said uncommon idea adds waft fresh air steam market typical initial learning curve hour system matches bots initial multiplayer matches practice gradually introducing live players match skill untill compeditive typical match minutes cutoff timers good teams ling time longest match played lasting thirty minues cons single player campign plot story contectualize events game greatly benifit given crew characters names faces thought alongside lor concept included interface shows lively world nt clearly world easily elements heard mention turd carpet microtransaction systems manipulative nearly result games require rediculus protracted economics order unlock games random number slot machine dynamics buying things want games near constant fight non paying playerbase demans balance paying playerbase demands good reason pay extras fractured space shows signs fight game store entirely different kinds objects sale skins modifiers skins cosmetic changes ship looks modifiers crew implants boosters change ship performs given match starter crew implants means players pay implants early performance advantage players nt crews implants earned time long long long time having bought early half crews needed played new implementations game economy gradually increased time crew unlocks dramaticly problem effect crew implants minor point attentive free player theoritically outmaneuver strategize pay player makes varous packs offer kind mute sale struggle find reason buy nt controll implants dedicated packs crew pods crew case crew gets autotraded dna available game currencies designed exponentally difficult unlock half available crew options recommend fractured space overall new players understand jumping treadmeal longer update alienated older era gamer younger generation eager accept way play fun playing irritated time finish match awarderd little earnings match gives vanguard player takes month frugal game currency saving afford largest implant crewpod pack game free thought alongisde constant reminders buy platnum mocks economy buy platnum tiers random content packs fall buy platnum actually need order buy packs developers microtransactions fine unlock option available people like know exactly maximum possible spending choose skip randum number let spend real money credit card exactly want game want gamble drive hour las vegas hit slots chance reomte walk away actual money

For a buy to play premium membership cash shop title the level of polish missing is unaccetable. I could see this being fine with most people if it was f2p like it was intended to be but in it's current state no money it worth investing. I only did 1-40 but the experience was mind numbing and at no point did I remotely enjoy it. There are plenty of videos to watch of emissaries turning their opinions around and talking about all the issues in the game. These are CORE mechanic issues that won't be fixed overnight or anytime soon. If you really wanna invest this much money into this game to maybe get a playable experience a year from now you are a saint of a person someone I'm not. The promises made during interviews and press conference were not lived up to and once again neowiz blatantly lies and manipulated it's content creators to advertise a fake version of the game that doesn't exist. If anyone is actually enjoying themselves playing this i'd be surprised. Also on side note not sure how Bluehole feels about the blatantly copied assetts they used in the game that are directly copied from Tera. Also even if you have a super PC you will get 20-30 fps at all times in this game. Large scale pvp drops to about 5 fps and world bosses about the same. It's literally unplayable and not fun.

1771,9724,9728,Elsword,"Elsword is a whole lot of fun if you're into fighting games. The game has an interesting cast of characters and very, very many choices regarding movesets and playstyle. The game's  skills system is expansive and sometimes seems too big, but I'm an indecisive person, so I just had to deal with it. The core game mechanics are wonderful, and the ability to chain combos off of one another almost flawlessly is incredibly gratifying. The equipable weapon and armor system is interesting, but it can get very annoying to micromanage and the sheer amount of items and numbers to consider can be a turnoff. One major complaint I have is that the game seems to be centered around these events that keep you playing. The game will give you the opportunity to find these crazy items and equipable armor or weapons, which is awesome and all, but you can lag behind a lot if you miss an event. In short, the game struggles heavily with power creep- they keep ramping up the power of these exclusive weapons and items so that you can be even stronger if you get the stuff from this event, and the cycle continues as the stats go higher. Also, the item drops can get flat out ridiculous. For instance, on my main character I accumulated over 1200 Complete Recovery Potions. Those things restore all your hp and mp! What the hell?! This basically makes me unkillable in any dungeon of my level, which makes the game cool for a little bit but boring and trudging after a while. Overall though, I'd recommend it.",1, elsword lot fun fighting games game interesting cast characters choices movesets playstyle game skills system expansive big indecisive person deal core game mechanics wonderful ability chain combos flawlessly incredibly gratifying equipable weapon armor system interesting annoying micromanage sheer items numbers consider turnoff major complaint game centered events playing game opportunity find crazy items equipable armor weapons awesome lag lot miss event short game struggles heavily power ramping power exclusive weapons items stronger stuff event cycle continues stats higher item drops flat ridiculous instance main character accumulated complete recovery potions things restore hp mp hell basically makes unkillable dungeon level makes game cool little bit boring trudging overall recommend

1778,11206,11210,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI've played many CCGs, including Magic (I'm currently in the beta for Arena), Hearthstone, Spellweaver, and Shadowverse. I've been playing Eternal for about 2 months now and I can honestly say that of all the CCGs I've played, Eternal is my favourite. It takes elements from many of these other games and improves on them. It has the complexity of Magic (without the finicky stop points and minutiae) and the fast pace of Hearthstone (without the RNG and over-simplicity). Since I found Eternal, I've hardly logged into Magic Arena beta because Eternal is a lot more fun. The mechanics are original and creative, allowing for meaningful decisions that affect the outcome of the game. Progression is well-paced (even though I've spent some money on the game, I don't get everything handed to me and have to work towards a bigger collection by completing quests and earning daily rewards). Lots of different game modes, both PvP and PvE means there's something for everyone (and every mood). The meta is also very healthy. Don't listen to the negative reviews complaining about the state of the meta a week or two after a new set release - they simply haven't figured out how to counter some of the strategies being played, which is what CCGs are all about! The Eternal meta is way more diverse and healthy than the other CCGs I mentioned above - there are 6+ viable top tier decks at any given time, and some of these don't require any legendary cards (see the recent ETS tournament results for proof of this). The community is great too - lots of helpful friendly people on the sub-Reddit.

1780,15465,15470,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,"The game is pay to win. There is no end game, and only endless chests or hours of mindless grinding will get you real progress. The problem is the loot system which works on a 5 tier system: common, uncommon, rare, epic and golden epic. The loot is progressive so uncommon is a better version of common, rare is a better version of uncommon, and so on. There is no choice of equipment - they simply keep the highest tier available and disenchant the rest.Common, uncommon and rare drop from silver chests, the game's currency which each contain 3 items. VERY rarely a silver chest will be upgraded for free (about one in a hundred?) from a silver chest to a 'Jewelled' chest.These jewelled chests contain 5 items one of which will be rare or above. EPIC gear can only be had from these chests. These chests are sold 3 for $4.99. Buying chests is the difference between 'I might get the achievements this week' and 'See you in 2025'. Chest purchases also grant you a 24 hour 100% damage increase. Cheap, eh?What's worse is the Golden Epics. They come with 'flash sales' which appear periodically to try and pressure you into buying them within a 8-10 hour window. They are ridiculously powerful. Many grant 150% bonuses when common items might be 5%. There are ALOT of these golden epics. You'd have to spend hundreds of dollars just to get those that exist right now, and more to get those they add with each update. Power creep is inherent here - they bring out new characters and gear to outdate the stuff you paid for so you'll buy more stuff. It's a hamster wheel of pay to win crap.What's worse is the dev's have had bugs with the Golden Epic system awarding the wrong things - and refusing to correct all of it even though it's their fault. Even if you give them REAL MONEY for a in-game digital benefit which costs them nothing, they'll still give you the short end of the stick if their crap system glitches.This is nothing but a mobile phone quality java game that rewards continuous spending and excessive playtime over any semblence of logic, skill, or ability.

It's matured to the point the balance changes are made with the aim of keeping things fresh instead of putting out fires. There are very few other games that can give you the same feeling that Dreadnought provides, and none that I've played recently. The visual aesthetics are fantastic, and with the Steam release the game now has audio to match that gravitas.I am a fan of the fluidity of the new UI introduced for the Steam release as well. It needs some refinement* but over all it is much slicker and more modern than the previous iteration. I reccommend this game to all fans of the vehicle shooter genre. It is familiar enough that anyone who has played Mech Warrior Online, Star Conflict, Fractured Space, Crossout, Roblox, etc. will be able to get into the hotseat right away. And at the same time it is a different beast altogether, I guarantee you'll enjoy the feeling of unstoppable power that comes with piloting a ship the size of a city block.*some resizing to follow PC UI conventions, higher res module icons, better menu mapping to reduce number of clicks needed, and get rid of that ugly ""Edit Ship"" button",1, playing game years tester gameplay standard competitive multiplayer matured point balance changes aim keeping things fresh instead putting fires games feeling dreadnought provides played recently visual aesthetics fantastic steam release game audio match gravitas fan fluidity new ui introduced steam release needs refinement slicker modern previous iteration reccommend game fans vehicle shooter genre familiar played mech warrior online star conflict fractured space crossout roblox etc able hotseat right away time different beast altogether guarantee enjoy feeling unstoppable power comes piloting ship size city resizing follow pc ui conventions higher res module icons better menu mapping reduce number clicks needed rid ugly edit ship button

Variance is an issue, but not any more than you would expect from a game that utilizes this mana system.I like that unlike Hearthstone and Shadowverse, the devs take a positive approach to balancing the meta. Instead of releasing overpowered cards before nerfing them, in Eternal, cards tend to be buffed a lot more often than they are nerfed, unless there is a real power level issue. The devs have also made it incredibly easy to build tier decks - their generosity is unlike any other CCG I've played. Of course, legend heavy decks are a long shot, but there are very powerful budget options that still remain tier decks, and that makes up for it. Even then, with some dedicated grinding and smart dusting, you can still craft at least a different legendary playset per week.Nevertheless, gameplay is always fun and varied, draft is the closest you have to an actual MTG draft barring MTGO, and there is support for almost any deck archetype.

1823,9158,9162,PlanetSide 2,"Insanely awesome. Those are the best two words that describe this game. No other shooter perfectly captures the epic sci-fi battles that take place as three massive armies clash for territory. When you walk into a battle, you don't just see people pointing, shooting and killing. You've got several heavy assaults laying down suppressive fire while the medics are running around, dodging bullets and fearlessly jumping into the heart of battle to save their fallen comrades.

1831,7980,7984,Neverwinter,"Ignore the steam hours listed, I have well over 2 thousand hours into the game - I previously played via the Arc launcher before saying screw that and moving over to steam. With that being said, I do not recommend this game. On the surface it seems alright, especially if you have a group of friends to play with, but the game is...redundant at best.Pros Graphically, it's not bad. It scales well and works great on older systems while still not looking like a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Several classes for some flexibility with playstyle. Easy to follow, pre-defined questing. Something akin to ""crafting"" which is fairly easy to do and progress. Frequent in-game events. Decent storyline, if you pay enough attention.Cons There hasn't been a new class released in literally years, and the devs fight over whether or not there will be a new one anytime soon (there probably won't be, don't get your hopes up). Pay to win. Despite claims from much of the game's population the game is pay to win and there's really no way around that. Certainly, you can grind for (two thousand) hours and maybe, possibly get through much of the campaigns - but as far as end-game content goes you will be required by groups to run ""best in slot"" which requires SOMEONE (maybe not you, particularly) to pay real-life money for an item (bonding runestones) that can only be obtained from the cash store (zen marketplace). Not doing so means most, if not all, groups will refuse to run with you because you will be deemed ""not good enough"" since you won't be able to break and trivialize the game otherwise. End-game lacks content and difficulty outside of PvP - and even that is lacking in truly engaging content. Sub-par voice acting. You'd think with how much they charge for things in the zen-market they could have gotten some half-way decent voice actors, but no. It's laughable at best, cringe-worthy at worst. You will literally spend all of your time doing the same thing over and over again for hours on end in an attempt to progress through campaigns - it will still take you about 2 months to do so unless you pay real-world money. Laughable crafting system. While it is certainly easy to do and progress through, it's not worth doing in the slightest since you won't use anything you get from it. It's also a joke, as far as crafting systems go. If you're not running the ""Best in Slot"" (BiS) builds you will be shunned. Toxic, elitest, stuck-up, and otherwise snobby community. Frequent arguments relating to...pretty much anything and everything in zone chat. Bots. Lots and lots of bots. So much chat spam. No matter how many you report/ignore there never seems to be any less of them. Incredibly expensive for being a free-to-play.TL;DR - if you aren't already playing with several hundred/thousand hours logged, don't bother. It isn't worth the time or money.^ As of 11/26/2018 the above still holds true. However, there have been some updates that have made me reconsider the idea that it's not worth ever getting in to.

After a few hours, that was not enough anymore then I started to play Team Deathmatch and Battle Arena. At TD there's no reason to play serious. Even if you get top score, if you die you'll receive the same Bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match (after do some damage to an enemy, only). There's no teamwork because only the top score ALIVE at the end of the match will receive the Protonium box, so is just a race for kills and points. If by any chance you finish the match alive, but you did no damage to an enemy, you'll not receive any box: 0 score = 0 box, even on the winning team.BA has (usually) better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base, but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast,  My main complain about this game is:There's no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and 5 cubes as base, just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design.

1864,3359,3362,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access Review My First ""TryHard"" Review  Because This Game Deserves It! Firstly, I'm a hardcore game hopper, because I find flaws fast that drive me away from the game. A lot of games to date push out a title that is there just to make quick money and lacks creativity, replayability, and polished gameplay mechanics. There are also those games that go so hard into realism that it makes a ""game"" overwhelming and tedious. Luckily for those interested in a new Battle Royal, this is not the case! Off the start, I was AMAZED by the character customization. It is so innovated and gorgeous, followed by the music tracks in the background, are outstanding. It actually pumps you up! Lets get down to the brass tax.PROSGraphicsCreativityMusicCustomizationSmooth GameplayShooting down someone that is trying to escape, when there are plenty of seats on the chopper to evacuate the remaining players!!!The evacuation mechanic itself is really an awesome ending to the match, not just ""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."" Its called trying NUBG..It is not overly complex, and the attachments auto-install is super nice and smoothWhen prone, (and this is a goodin') your character actually swivels his/her body, in order to do a 360 and turns on their @$$ in order to face 180. Tired of getting that ankle caught on a twig in NUBG?

1884,15495,15500,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,"Update:After a crazy number of hours spent on this game, I quit due to the poor design choices made when implementing Legendary items.  The game became horribly imbalanced and no longer fun to play as the core mechanism, tweaking formations, was replaced by P2W.  Horribly disappointing turn of events for a formerly great game.Original review:This game really surprised me.  It\'s an incredibly simple concept, your crusaders are walking along, enemies show up, and they kill them, gold drops, you level up, ad nausium.  The game designers have managed to turn it into a surprisingly deep bit of strategy with combinations of gear, formations, abilities, missions, etc that all interact so that no experience of the game is the same until much later when you\'ve got most of the gear and the math begins to flatten out.The time recorded in game is a bit deceptive, as I leave it running in the background.  Actual interaction time is FAR lower, that said it\'s an epic grind to get all the campaigns completed and will likely take you months or years of on-off play unless you shell out lots of $$$.

1887,7401,7405,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"Not too happy with this game, after playing the included campaign basically everything costs gold or cash. Farming gold is kinda slow (you need 3-4 daily missions for 1 event ticket), and to unlock another campaign or state-of-the-art decks, you'll need about 20-40 dailies.There are resources to improve cards that are quite grindy to get.In addition, even if you have all the stuff to improve cards, you might notice that your level is too low for that and you'll have to grind some more.The AI decks look pretty rigged to me, and the campaign often gives advantages to the opponents.It suffers from all TCG probs like getting wrong cards at the wrong time, while opponents seems to get just what they need. To compensate, the AI seems to play worse when you retry a campaign mission, so even the dumbest will make it at some point so he can purchase the next campaign.Card packs (6 cards) cost 2 bucks, and more often than not contain crap cards or cards for different schools you can't use with your main deck.Event tickets are 2 bucks each, and you can fight up to 9 AI opponents for rewards, but without some special cards, you'll start to loose after 3-5 enemies, making this a bit cheaper than buying packs, but still expensive.Not a bad game if you want to spend some bucks or invest serious time to unlock things, but for casual play, it's just to grindy and boring.

1888,14567,14572,Robocraft,"Product received for freeThis game crashes. A LOT.Why, I have to admit, this new ""Epic Loot"" update is great... For the first hour or two if it's your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumby ones you get the very first time you play the game. Though once you get over how ""amazing"" that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is, you'll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish, especially since you have to buy premium to get half of what's in the crates anyways. This crate system can be seen one of two ways; either pay-to-win, or getting on your knees and praying to the RNG gods that, once, just once, you'd get an epic item from your protonium crate. Also here's a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone; I found a stinkin' legendary item in a bronze crate, but I needed premium to have collected it (The same thing happened to my friend, but with a different item). Speaking of big guns, they are litterally all you need to excel at this game. I build a 750 pflop tank, and it loses to some tiny bot, 90% of which is a single gun. Seriously? I could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship. I guess not. But who am I trash talk micro-bots. I built one myself, and I can get 6 kills in a single deathmatch with it (most of the time building goes into where I should put more hoverblades). Finally, this game crashes. A lot. Though most of the time, it seems to happen when I finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well. What a coincedence.....2016-12-16 Edit: It's been a while and there have been many big changes to Robocraft so I feel that my review could use an update too. First off; my thoughts on the ""Fast and Formidable"" update. As a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts, I enjoyed having the ability to build a 2000 pflop (maximum value) robot. Although quite a few Robocraft veterans would disagree, I think this update was a small step in the right direction. I could build as I please, but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot. But this brawl update. This brawl update is no fun. Freejam has decided to (instead of listening to the community) remove multiple game modes, and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the ""Brawl"" mode. This would have been fine if they did it like Overwatch and just added a brawl as a new game mode, but no.

1891,6594,6598,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThis review is my opinion if you agree then so be it, if not then dont i can careless.Ok to start off with this review and why its negative for such a good game.This game was so much fun at the beginning its just a great game with so much potential..... Until it forces you into the bigger map's with higher levels that have all SPENT IRL $$$ for better guns or just earned every weapon already im stuck with a basic rifle vs machine guns, lightt machine guns, high power'd snipers, planes that constantly drop bombs on you, tanks and so fourth how is this fair that im stuck with a basic semi rifle with no addable items in which i mean you cant add a scope or anything to it. And have to wait A SUPER long time to even unlock anything good! i had a 2.20kd until i hit that certain level where everyone had better weapons than me and i really couldnt do anything, so THERE GIMIC is spend irl money to get a decent weapon.... another thing is how do they expect a BETA to get about 11.50 for each month of member just for bonus xp and lil extra s*** i very much enjoyed this game and loved ALMOST every moment up until the uninstall and i thank the developers for a good game to use some of my time on, but i will not recommend any game that forces you to spend your hard earned money just to enjoy a free game, sorry but no i'd rather find another free game to enjoy or spend my money to have a whole new game.P.S. thankyou for reading my review and i hope you take it into consideration, and you dont support such cheap gimic's so they can take all your cash and run.",0, early access reviewthis review opinion agree nt careless ok start review negative good game game fun beginning great game potential forces bigger map higher levels spent irl better guns earned weapon m stuck basic rifle vs machine guns lightt machine guns high snipers planes constantly drop bombs tanks fourth fair m stuck basic semi rifle addable items mean nt add scope wait super long time unlock good hit certain level better weapons nt gimic spend irl money decent weapon thing expect beta month member bonus xp lil extra s enjoyed game loved moment uninstall thank developers good game use time recommend game forces spend hard earned money enjoy free game sorry find free game enjoy spend money new game thankyou reading review hope consideration nt support cheap gimic cash run

1908,6314,6318,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThis game is constantly evolving; some addition good, some bad. There are a lot of people who don't like it, and I get it. Ive got 350 hours in the game, and when I ever have a large streak of kills, I could understand the anger from my victims. 2 years ago, the game was not like this. Literaly everyone was at the same level, so grinding was a piece of cake. As time passed, more and more people got better weapons, and that was that. Then a surge of people joined, and once they reached level 5, they were put into games with experience players, (such as I) all with one shot rifles up to an insane range. Guilty as charged. And it does not stop at the rifles. Even pistols can be upgraded to be a 3 shot kill at 50m. Also guilty as charged. So anyone who says the game is ""Pay to Win"", is partialy right. But it was not always that way. I had my friends play with me, and they were very angry at how the starting weapons are absolute garbage, and that they were dying too easily. The game has so much potential, but it is really only fun for people who have played for long enough.

Ships look great with lots of detail and adds to the immersion. I know this will sound generic, but this game, for me, just makes hopping in a big ship and shooting other people fun. I love space based settings and this game just makes me happy. As for gameplay, I've only played Conquest mode, not sure if the other one is available yet. It's kind of a MOBA-lite. No juggling of items, your ship is your character and they have a nice lot of them to  work toward, you choose from 3 types of upgrades once you get enough resources (attack, defense, utilities) and they simply just make your skills better. You still need to work as a team for map control (resources for upgrades + access to other teams base) and eventually attack the other ones base. This conflict is what leads to the glorious looking and fun space battles.I figured I would play this one and forget it, but I keep playing a  bit each day and it hits the spot.",1, early access reviewthis game pretty buggy alpha understandable finally game going fun ships look great lots detail adds immersion know sound generic game makes hopping big ship shooting people fun love space based settings game makes happy gameplay played conquest mode sure available kind moba lite juggling items ship character nice lot work choose types upgrades resources attack defense utilities simply skills better need work team map control resources upgrades access teams base eventually attack ones base conflict leads glorious looking fun space battles figured play forget playing bit day hits spot

1947,4203,4207,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"If you played and/or play the normal ""Yu-gi-oh"" card game, i do not recommend this. Its a sad immitation. Don't get me wrong its oddly enjoyable, i mean i put in 6 hours into it, and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then 30 minutes, but its not something i can take seriously.Cons:First, they cut the game in half, which means, half the deck size, half the HP, half the time, and half the cards on the field. Biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that, so that means you have cards the ask for 5000 HP and combo cards like exodia that are useless.The game forces you through a progression system, that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction. I understand explaining a game to someone, but anything bellow level 40 is no challenge at all, and thats with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥deck. To give example of how bad it is, level 20 and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss, and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long. The ai is super simple. Now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage 6 to even play against players. Just to clarify what i mean by no challenge, is the enemy  does not place spell or trap, and nothing above crappy regular 3 stars, which can be easily out done with one of your first cards.Last thing i have to say, is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical ""chinese knockoff"", they put in a attempt, tried to cut corners, and it turned out like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Pros(yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it):Matches are fast, so you can enjoy a few during a break.Its more portable, so yu-gi-oh on the go.Less money to get a insane amount of cards.Good way to try new cards, and card combos.They implement a ""auto-duel"" feature, making the boring duels shorter, more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck.Voice actors from the anime.",0, played play normal yu gi oh card game recommend sad immitation wrong oddly enjoyable mean hours bad dropped minutes seriously cons cut game half means half deck size half hp half time half cards field biggest issue changed cards fit means cards ask hp combo cards like exodia useless game forces progression system treats brain malfunction understand explaining game bellow level challenge s half deck example bad level bellow easy win hp loss stupid combos don long ai super simple bad grind fight stage play players clarify mean challenge enemy place spell trap crappy regular stars easily cards thing game reminds sterotypical chinese knockoff attempt tried cut corners turned like tried hard find thing good fast enjoy break portable yu gi oh money insane cards good way try new cards card combos implement auto duel feature making boring duels shorter sense decent deck voice actors anime

1949,12621,12625,RaceRoom Racing Experience,"Raceroom experience was a very frustrating experience!Update :- I have found a way to fix the main problem that I have with this game and that is to change traction control preset 0 from 0 to 100 in the car setup in the garage before a race (i.e. in practice or qualifying). I think what I was experiencing is called power on oversteer. Though I still cant believe that it should be anything like that bad in a real car :(Note this wont help you brake or go around a corner, it just means you wont spin off the track into the corner when you gently accelerate !I cant believe the developers have made this game so inaccessable when all they need to do is change 1 variable and it would be 30000 percent more playable to people who try the game !Btw I come at tihis as someone who generaly prefers more sim like games like gt legends, grid, dirt, test drive unlimited 2, nfs shift 2, race injection etc. But even with hundreds of experience on probably 20 different racing games I couldnt make it around a lap without it crashing from oversteer !I still hesitiate to recommend this game because of the sheer anount of frustration this issue caused meHere is my original review :-Raceroom experience is a very frustrating experience!This is mainly down to what I consider a fault in the physics model !The frustrations are :-1 (and this is the big 1) ) When accelerating out of a bend the car oversteers and crashes back into the bend it has come out of ! This is most noteable on raceroom raceway, on the corner at the start of the start finish straight. The track goes around a corner and up a hill, yet the car just uncontrolably spins with oversteer back towards the corner if power is applied.No amount of opposite lock corrects it, and it doesnt feel like the back end is trying to overtake the front end due to too much power. It feels like its turning in a circle for no good reason. Grrr !Though I have a feeling this is a common fault with a lot of so called sims. How many cars in the real world do you see spinning into the corner they have come out of ?This issue is probably more of a problem on raceroom raceway than most tracks. But that track in the standard yellow car (Canhard R52, sillhoutte series ?) sure does highlight it!Btw I have a g25 wheel and pedals and a fast pc (gtx970 etc). So I dont think my problems are down to my setup.Also I have witnessed many many drivers having the same problems on that track, so its not just me. Though the experienced drivers do work around the problem.2) If you do crash off, then the game takes 20 seconds to get going again. Either the car wont move at all or it just spins you into the opposite direction or you end up doing doughnuts. It will not spin and point in the right direction ! It doesnt matter if you are really subtle and gentle on the power or really heavy the result is the same ! Grrrr!I think other than this the physics are very good, the sound is very good, the graphics are a slight improvement over race 07, but not as good as say need for speed or project cars.Oh and I think the actual online multiplayer mechanics are good, which probably makes it one of the best online racing games, sim or otherwise on the pc (if and for me this might be too much of an if :- If you can adapt your driving style to ignore what I consider to be faulty physics).I like the way you can test drive the cars before buying, though generally the content is too expensive. Particularly buying multiple items doesnt give enough of a discount.Anyway, it would be a very good game, if it wasnt for what I consider to be a fault in one aspect of its physics model that makes it soooo frustrating :(",0, raceroom experience frustrating found way fix main problem game change traction control preset car setup garage race practice qualifying think experiencing called power oversteer nt believe like bad real car note wo nt help brake corner means wo nt spin track corner gently accelerate nt believe developers game inaccessable need change variable percent playable people try game btw come tihis generaly prefers sim like games like gt legends grid dirt test drive unlimited nfs shift race injection etc hundreds experience probably different racing games nt lap crashing oversteer hesitiate recommend game sheer anount frustration issue caused mehere original review experience frustrating mainly consider fault physics model frustrations big accelerating bend car oversteers crashes bend come noteable raceroom raceway corner start start finish straight track goes corner hill car uncontrolably spins oversteer corner power applied opposite lock corrects nt feel like end trying overtake end power feels like turning circle good reason grrr feeling common fault lot called sims cars real world spinning corner come issue probably problem raceroom raceway tracks track standard yellow car canhard sillhoutte series sure highlight wheel pedals fast pc etc nt think problems setup witnessed drivers having problems track experienced drivers work crash game takes seconds going car wo nt spins opposite direction end doughnuts spin point right direction nt matter subtle gentle power heavy result think physics good sound good graphics slight improvement race good need speed project cars oh think actual online multiplayer mechanics good probably makes best online racing games sim pc adapt driving style ignore consider faulty like way test drive cars buying generally content expensive particularly buying multiple items nt discount good game nt consider fault aspect physics model makes soooo frustrating
1950,10666,10670,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewHaving played MTG for lots of years, Hearthstone and recently dabbling into Gwent, i can definatly recommend this game to any CCG/ TCG player. The econmy in the game is very very generous compared to Hearstone & Co and its possible to build a competitive deck within a week of playing without investing a single cent in the game. You basically get a free pack every day for your first win and earn gold and cards from chestsfor every following win. There is even the chance that the chests you get upgrade and earn you even more gold, cards or packs.The gameplay is very reminsicent of MTG, which is no wonder considering that a lot of MTG greats like LSV or Patrick Chapin work on this game.There are several game modes where you can play either against other players or the AI.You can can play simple 1 on 1, Draft, Forge (Sealed against the AI), and there are ""Events"" that are only open for a limited time and have specific rules for either gameplay or deckbuilding.  Its even possible to grind for gold against the AI which makes it even easier to build a solid collection.The game is decently balanced and there is a lot of variation on the ladder going on. Last but not least, reaching the Masterrank in Eternal is by far not as big as a grind as reaching Legend in Heartstone or Grandmaster in Gwent and isnt just spamming a lot of games.If youre sick of the RNG and grind in hearthstone, the pirces in MTG or the current state of Gwent i can wholeheartly recomend this game to anyone who loves and plays CCG/ TCGs.",1, early access reviewhaving played mtg lots years hearthstone recently dabbling gwent definatly recommend game tcg player econmy game generous compared hearstone co possible build competitive deck week playing investing single cent game basically free pack day win earn gold cards chestsfor following win chance chests upgrade earn gold cards packs gameplay reminsicent mtg wonder considering lot mtg greats like lsv patrick chapin work game game modes play players play simple draft forge sealed ai events open limited time specific rules gameplay deckbuilding possible grind gold ai makes easier build solid collection game decently balanced lot variation ladder going reaching masterrank eternal far big grind reaching legend heartstone grandmaster gwent nt spamming lot games sick rng grind hearthstone pirces mtg current state gwent wholeheartly recomend game loves plays tcgs

It beats Heartstone in the simple fact that the MINIMUM deck size is 50 (Heartstones MAX limit of 30 is arbitrary and the single worst limitation of the whole game, maybe it's changed by now but I've moved on, a long time ago); it's awesome.

The amount of ways to play, solo, online, story, arenas, random weekly challenges; it's awesome.

1952,13070,13074,Fallout Shelter,"On mobile this game seems good, but on PC it doesn't fit; the game requires you to pick it up multiple times a day and only needs your attention for short periods of time, so I found myself easily bored.One thing I give this game credit for is how much it made me laugh in the short time I played it.  To gain additional vault dwellers you either accept outsiders or mate your existing inhabitants.  There was 1 man, of whom become known as Stud McQueen, whos designated post was the living quarters (aka the insemination chamber).  This sexual beast of a man became the father of every child born in the vault.  Unfortunately, the children all came to term at the same time when I checked up on them last evening and panic ensued.  Six babies were delivered with no medical assistance onto the living room carpet, those stains will never come out.  The resulting population boom saw a period of shortages of food and water, the vault's inhabitants began to suffer.... everyone except Stud McQueen, who was perpetually at 100% happiness... the cvnt..........

1954,5898,5902,DCS World Steam Edition,"Bear Trap campaign for F-15C seems broken after last patch.  Mission 2 you run SEAD for a DEAD attack on ground targets and the F-16s fly below 9000 feet and get shot down by SAMs.  I'm sure a lot of the missions for other aircraft are fine, but I bought the F-15 module, and after latest patch, where they claim to have ""fixed"" all F-15 missions, I have had nothing but issues.  I don't have my HOTAS out to see about the A-10C or anything, as I am using my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, so I don't have to swap my racing pedals for my rudder pedals, as I am doing some racing sims and stuff at the moment too, but my logitech has twist, and F-15C isn't overly complex.  I have had issues with Missions as well, with one of the couple of missions that exist, loads multiple F-15s at the same location as my aircraft, causing all of them to explode.  I'll buy the F-18, when an actual campaign comes out for it, providing the campaign isn't buggy, but I don't like the fact that I can't use a favorite aircraft of mine that I just want to have fun with.  One of the instant start missions begins at night for the F-15, however, the F-15 doesn't allow night vision.  I don't want to lose the ability to use aircraft from the past, because new aircraft and maps are introduced that take priority over the older aircraft.

1955,1126,1129,Fractured Space,"Update 09 May 18:       Much has changed since I last made any comments about FS.... I would like to say they have brought the game many miles and really changed, evolved and improved the game.  I still enjoy playing and the new wave mode called Last Stand is a great deal of fun and will test the best of players.  I've managed to reach wave 14 a couple times with some other skilled players.  A great bit o fun.  I would like to see some AI changes to the waves.  For now, they are predictable, which is okay, and part of how we can prep for each wave and attempt to push futher into them ... However, taking that to a new level of unpredictability would be cool.  Early Alpha Comments::So far the game is fun ... It does have more balancing to work out, but that's always typical for Alpha state ... Anyone who loves space games would enjoy it ... Maps are very limited right now in Alpha ... Latency is a HUGE issue ... my one true negative ... yes, its free service, and in Alpha ... but its very hard to play with horrible latency ... Crashes a lot ... to much, hopefully more polishing will fix these bugs ... and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part about the crash, once you drop from a server, you loose all stats from that match ... so if you are playing for 30 mikes and boom, you crash, everything from that game time is wasted ... NO way to rejoin a match ... hopfully this will change in the future when more of a solid state of the game is created ... So far, I like the game, it has much potential and I'll play from time to time and really hope for the best.",1, update changed comments fs like brought game miles changed evolved improved game enjoy playing new wave mode called stand great deal fun test best players managed reach wave couple times skilled players great bit o fun like ai changes waves predictable okay prep wave attempt push futher taking new level unpredictability cool early alpha far game fun balancing work typical alpha state loves space games enjoy maps limited right alpha latency huge issue true negative yes free service alpha hard play horrible latency crashes lot hopefully polishing fix bugs crash drop server loose stats match playing mikes boom crash game time wasted way rejoin match hopfully change future solid state game created far like game potential play time time hope best

1958,7155,7159,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"yeah im getting super frustrated on how matching works in this game.  I cant find people remotely close to my skill level. I mean its real fun to lose 7 matches in a row ranked/casual and win once then lose another 8. All cause people have decks that just beat me in like 3-4 turns easy. Ive got my best cards in my deck and I find it impossible to win any games. not very fun. Just want to actually enjoy the game by playing people who don't destroy me instantly cause they spent too much time making a perfect deck.  so far the only enjoyable part of this game is the story. its taking so much not to just start full out cursing. Literally playing casual cause thats all to do in this game and after losing 8 matches in a row i make a new deck. red yellow, 15ish creatures all under 4 mana cost, rest are all item buffs and actions. Plan was to make a very easy to use buff deck to spam high attack and win fast, as i had view cards that cost over 5 mana. (as decks like this beat me like 4 times in a row) before i had been using a green purple deck filled with magicka buff cards, pilfer cards, and lethal cards. first game i use it in, destroyed by a dude that got out 4 supports 3 were the gives all friendly creatues a +1 +1 and the other gave him a 2/3 guard creature every turn (i think it was a 2/3) and he just spammed guards, and item buffs and beat me almost instantly. Next guy i play is a green blue deck and he litterally got out 2 of those bats that had drain and then had cards to destroy any creature i played before i even got a chance to use them and beat me like that. Next i played a deck that spammed lethal and damage cards, by turn 4 he had 4 lethal cards in a single row and creature i had played has been instantly destroyed and my health was down to 15. Like how the [censored] am i supposed to compete with these people. Im only level 12 what the hell.

1959,14034,14038,Infestation: The New Z,"Compared to the majority of previous...attemps at making this game what it could of been, I believe it has hit closest to home. Having beginner servers where it feels like the PvP is equally matched, as well as a place where new players can experience the overly done amount of loot is great, as when you hop on an official server that has high population, there's no doubt that you'll be popped in moments by a sniper depending on where you are (That's a downfall, but the majority of the time this can be avoided by just carefully selecting a server). The game mode 'Battle Royale' is great fun, but it feels like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top 10 and don't come in the top 3. I find that I reach the top 10 in a good amount of games, only to die before getting to the top 3 as people with heavy amounts of meds can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle is tiny, so they can easily pick you off. The PvP servers are good, if you have already gathered a mighty stash worth of guns that you really don't care about losing (A lot of game time till these servers become viable I believe).The warmup servers helpful as you don't lose your gear, but you do lose your consumables, so you need to bring a whole lot of meds & ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warming up.Overall, this type of game is still toxic, but a lot better than the previous ones and it does seem like it's heading in the right direction, there's bad parts, but good counter parts.",1, compared majority previous attemps making game believe hit closest home having beginner servers feels like pvp equally matched place new players experience overly loot great hop official server high population doubt popped moments sniper depending downfall majority time avoided carefully selecting server game mode battle royale great fun feels like heavy waste time reach come find reach good games die getting people heavy amounts meds sit radiation zone longer safezone circle tiny easily pick pvp servers good gathered mighty stash worth guns care losing lot game time till servers viable warmup servers helpful lose gear lose consumables need bring lot meds ammo gamemode achieve warming overall type game toxic lot better previous ones like heading right direction bad parts good counter parts

1962,14091,14095,Infestation: The New Z,"I played this Emulator of Infestation/WarZ before they had plans of releasing it on Steam and take my word on this....This Emulator is how Infestation should be played. My Buddy and I slay kids on this game and have loads of fun doing it. But while this Emulator is amazing it isn't perfect. Some history about this game you should know, the creator Fredaikis use to be an ISS hacker himself who got banned and decided to make his own emulator and anti-cheat with it. The Irony in it all is the original developers of ISS who banned him initially praised him for his work and made NewZ officially licensed by their company.

Campos especially, people litterally spawn on top of each other and at that point its a matter of who's going to lose their spawn shield first and lose their sh*t.- 4 man clans, an issue that has ruined this games PvP since I began playing. trying to do small PvP and having these clans of 4, 5, 6, even 8 roll in mowing the place down isn't fun.Overall amazing emulator highly recommend this version of Infestation to anyone that's into PvPing.",1, played emulator infestation warz plans releasing steam word emulator infestation played buddy slay kids game loads fun emulator amazing perfect history game know creator fredaikis use iss hacker got banned decided emulator anti cheat irony original developers iss banned initially praised work newz officially licensed company kind cringe play game times skins older skins purchased gd game dollars far loads ar snipers looting general feels rewarding custom loads maps including modifications older little hackers maybe came accross near hours playing developers actually listen care community shot foot wiped snipers everyones gi little year ago lost large fan base including decided bring asking community uses crappy engine optimization anyones fixed aim bug bullets randomly shoot spawns terrible jump high pop campos especially people litterally spawn point matter going lose spawn shield lose man clans issue ruined games pvp began playing trying small pvp having clans roll mowing place fun overall amazing emulator highly recommend version infestation pvping

1966,1720,1723,Dota 2,"One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry.Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest.Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire .Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa.So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck!So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic.  So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.

1977,13029,13033,Fallout Shelter,"First off, I wouldn't consider this a proper game, and I wouldn't give it a score out of 10. It's a distraction, and a fun one in that. Judging from other reviews, it seems alot of users have issue with it being a mobile game, being expected to wait hours to do anything, microtransactions and boring 'gameplay'. Just because it's a mobile game on PC, doesn't mean you're expected to play it like a PC game! I think the progression so far is really fun (I have amassed about 60 dwellers at around level 25, I reckon I'm halfway through the standard progression chain), as your vault and dwellers change aesthetically and in size. You get new features as you play, like the Overseers Office that let you dispatch your dwellers on quests (AKA stimpack simulator) and a wealth of weaponry and other customisation options which fits the universe.It's a fun experience to boot up before bed or during a revision break to do quests or queue something up for the next time you boot it up.

1979,4791,4795,SMITE®,"QUICK EDIT: Like I stated before the game is amazing but with the recent additon of EAC, its hard for me to like HiRez, but the game is still fantastic and most of the EAC bugs have been ironed out. Giving this game a full review as I feel it deserves it.TL;DRThe game is good, there is no question about it. While there may be issues here and there, they aren't significant enough to hinder the enjoyment of the game (most of the time). If you're looking to get into the MOBA scene, I think this is one of the best games to get started in. A variety of different gamemodes keeps the game fresh and keeps me coming back for more.The GoodBusiness Model:This game has one of the best business models on the F2P market. While its no dota for giving you every hero for free, it does get pretty damn close. Gods are usually around 5500 favor (standard currency) and earning this currency is easier than any other MOBA. You can also buy the ultimate god pack which gives you every current god (about 80 gods) and every future god for free, all for about $40. Hats off to HiRez for having a fantastic F2P business model.Gameplay:Its no secret smite's major difference is its unique 3rd person camera. Its also nice to say HiRez has done an amazing job at making a fun and engaging game through this 3rd person perspective. It seems like there is never a dull moment while playing, especially when going into some of the more unique modes like Assualt and Clash. The 3rd person perspective also makes this MOBA expierence extremely easy for new players to come into. The main gameplay also feels incredibly satisfying. character design is pretty good and most characters have some unique aspect to them without a lot of gods repeating each others kits.Gamemodes:Something SMITE does better than most other MOBA's is having a variety of gamemodes to pick from. SMITE has 6 different main gamemodes that all have a unique twist to them. Some of the more interesting modes include arena; basically consistaning of, well, a gaint arean where the main focus is to kill the other team. Assault is a one lane gamemode where you cannot go back to the fountain (base) until you are killed, and you are also randomly assigned a god. Siege is a gamemode where your main focus is to kill 100 minions to spawn a siege monster that will move down one of two lanes to help you destroy enemy towers. The mode feels similar to the traditional MOBA conquest mode, but adds a unique spin to change things up. This is what I would say is SMITE's biggest advantage over other MOBA's. The many different gamemodes keep the game fresh.The MehGame Balance and HiRez (Developers):While it would be extremely easy for me to completely trash the balance and the developers for making some pretty blatantly stupid decisions, i'm going to give the the benfit of the doubt.While HiRez are not perfect devs, they are better than most. It's a hit or miss with HiRez, sometimes they do some really awesome stuff that makes me love them as devs; whether it be listening to the community and having a form of respect for their playerbase. However, sometimes they really ♥♥♥♥ up. Remember when I said they make some blatantly stupid mistakes? Well sometimes its really bad and their silent treatment on hot topic issues make it seem like they dont care or are simply ignoring the problem in hopes people forget and move on. my main gripe being the recent addition of EAC (Easy Anti Cheat), but ill go into that later.    Balance for the most part is okay. They have come a long way from 4 years ago when I started playing. New god releases are usually pretty good with only a few minor nerfs/ buffs being needed. There are the occasional times when they release/ make a change to a god that is so OP it hurts the enjoyment of the game, but those are pretty few and far between as of right now.Community:I'm not going into this one to much as all online communities are pretty awful. SMITE is unforunately no exception, but I will say its better than most. The game has its fair share of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that can/ will harass you for the smallest of things. At the same time, there are a lot of nice and friendly people and its how I met my current group of friends, some of which I've known for three+ years now. Take what you will, my time with the community over the past 4 years has been meh.The BadEAC:EAC or its full name of Easy Anti Cheat, is one of the WORST 3rd party anti cheat softwares out there. Seriously this♥♥♥♥♥♥is hot garbage and its no different in SMITE. There are have been many cases of people being kicked (not banned) from games at random because of EAC. There has also been a few instances of people getting out right banned for the dumbest reasons. Beware.Servers:Holy.♥♥♥♥♥♥ I dont know where to start when it comes to servers. They have been hot garbage for the past 4 years. HiRez after all this time seems to make very little effort to upgrade or improve them. It seems like every patch there is an extended period of downtime due to overloaded servers. HiRez, you're not a small company anymore, FIX YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥Polish, Bugs, and Glitches:This is pretty big issue for me. The game is going on 4 years (If you include the year of open beta) and it still feels like a beta. There are so many bugs and so many glitches that have been in the game for years! It also seems to be getting worse with every patch as there are more and more. I know slowing down doesnt make HiRez money but the game needs some love in the technical department. This is no longer a small game and HiRez is no longer a small company, these things need to get fixed.-[ELORE]RastaNation ",1, quick edit like stated game amazing recent additon eac hard like hirez game fantastic eac bugs ironed giving game review feel deserves game good question issues significant hinder enjoyment game time looking moba scene think best games started variety different gamemodes keeps game fresh keeps coming goodbusiness model game best business models market dota giving hero free pretty damn close gods usually favor standard currency earning currency easier moba buy ultimate god pack gives current god gods future god free hats hirez having fantastic business model gameplay secret smite major difference unique person camera nice hirez amazing job making fun engaging game person perspective like dull moment playing especially going unique modes like assualt clash person perspective makes moba expierence extremely easy new players come main gameplay feels incredibly satisfying character design pretty good characters unique aspect lot gods repeating kits gamemodes smite better moba having variety gamemodes pick smite different main gamemodes unique twist interesting modes include arena basically consistaning gaint arean main focus kill team assault lane gamemode fountain base killed randomly assigned god siege gamemode main focus kill minions spawn siege monster lanes help destroy enemy towers mode feels similar traditional moba conquest mode adds unique spin change things smite biggest advantage moba different gamemodes game fresh mehgame balance hirez extremely easy completely trash balance developers making pretty blatantly stupid decisions going benfit doubt hirez perfect devs better hit miss hirez awesome stuff makes love devs listening community having form respect playerbase remember said blatantly stupid mistakes bad silent treatment hot topic issues like nt care simply ignoring problem hopes people forget main gripe recent addition eac easy anti cheat ill later balance okay come long way years ago started playing new god releases usually pretty good minor buffs needed occasional times change god op hurts enjoyment game pretty far right community going online communities pretty awful smite unforunately exception better game fair share s harass smallest things time lot nice friendly people met current group friends known years time community past years meh badeac eac easy anti cheat worst party anti cheat softwares seriously hot garbage different smite cases people kicked banned games random eac instances people getting right banned dumbest reasons beware servers holy nt know start comes servers hot garbage past years hirez time little effort upgrade improve like patch extended period downtime overloaded servers hirez small company anymore fix polish bugs glitches pretty big issue game going years include year open beta feels like beta bugs glitches game years getting worse patch know slowing nt hirez money game needs love technical department longer small game hirez longer small company things need

1988,10658,10662,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewI played several CCG and this one simply gives me the best overall experience. To name a few merits:- MTG-like mechanism offers deep strategy choices. It's richer than Hearthstone attacker choice mechanism, and I also like to be able to interact during the attack phase.- F2P friendly. There are many ways to get free cards. It's way more generous than Hearthstone. But legendary cards are still expensive and you often need 4 copies. That's why I mainly stick with aggo decks. Not that I like the aggressiveness, but they often depend on cheaper cards.- Nice UI. The UI is easy to use and it's fast to play. Magic Duels has clumsy UI which breaks the game.- Cross-play between platforms. Half of my playtime was on Android. CCG is the type of game fits mobile phones well and I like to be able to play it any time I want. Gwent is another excellent CCG, but it lacks Android & iOS versions so I didn't invest much time on it.- Deck builder is one of the best I have used.

1989,2994,2997,War Thunder,"I have been playing this game since 2013, before it was on Steam, so Steam probably shows no time played. First off, the game is decent. It can be fun at times and there are plenty of vehicles to use. I will acknowledge it does have SOME good aspects. But sadly, the bad outweighs the good.First off, the mods are people who are being paid by Gaijin to ensure nothing bad is ever said about the game. If you even mention something about the game in either the chat or the forums, you will get banned. The mods do not warn and do not give any reasons for it. They just claim you verbally abused them while they just do nothing about people actually throwing out racial slurs and other actual verbal abuse. So do not play this game if you want to be able to talk openly about it.The other major problem is that Gaijin NEVER fixes anything. There have been issues with the game people have been asking to be fixed since 2013 and they have still never even been looked at. But then again, with how the mods always ban everyone for mentioning there is a problem with the game, that may be why. They also continually change aspects of the game that are for no other purpose than potentially getting more money from people.",0, playing game steam steam probably shows time played game decent fun times plenty vehicles use acknowledge good aspects sadly bad outweighs good mods people paid gaijin ensure bad said game mention game chat forums banned mods warn reasons claim verbally abused people actually throwing racial slurs actual verbal abuse play game want able talk openly major problem gaijin fixes issues game people asking fixed looked mods ban mentioning problem game continually change aspects game purpose potentially getting money people
1990,6176,6180,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewThis game is most likely the worst game I have ever played in my life. For the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game.      Then comes level 3. After level 3 the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either p2w f***, or just people who have played longer. If you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. Your gun takes 2-3 hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend 10-30 seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. Doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? And if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are 10 times worse. They camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. If you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. The player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. But, the game has to have tanks. You cant have a WWII war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level 3 to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to 10 tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. In assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their #1 enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish)       Let's move on to the economy. Every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. You also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. Now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. Any half decent gun costs $50,000+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. The game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but I have 65 hours into the game and still have trash weapons. I'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so I can get better weapons. [EDIT 1]: Oops! Silly me, I forgot about one of the most important things! You might be thinking ""Okay, this game is in Beta, it still has potential, right?"" Well, this latest update made me think wrong. The Soviet Union was added as a faction (team) to the game. Now, first of all, for the majority of the war the U.S. and the Soviet Union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. I dont. What I do care about is the fact that they made the Soviet Union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior; especially the PPD-40. The PPD is a 71 round mag smg. Compared to the M3 Grease gun and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP34, its totally op. The next smg you get is the PPsH. Once again, 71 round mag, upgradable to 900 rpm (rounds per minute). 71 shots at 900 rpm = op. [EDIT 2]: As you can see, my hours have raised since I wrote this review. Now, this is not because I'm a hypocrite, its becuase my little brother hasn't realized that this game is not a good game, and everyday forces me to play with him. Once he realizes, just like me, that this is not a good game, I will have no reason to play it.[EDIT 3]: Let's also talk about AT (Anti-Tank). Tanks in this game are completely unbalanced, especially in skirmish, but at least the developers were kind enough to give us infantry a way to kill tanks. Mines, sticky grendes, and rocket launchers. For grenades and mines, you have to be right up near the tank, which is impossible to do if they are camping or have infantry guarding them. Rocket launchers are a little bit better, but they take up so much inventory space you can only cary a SA-rifle or a BA-rifle, and you can barely sprint. The other thing is that the game doesn't want people destroying tanks, so they make the AT weapons so overpriced they are literally unusable. Sticky grenades are the best example. It takes 3 sticky grenades to destroy a tank. The cost of using 3 sticky grenades is 1100 credits. (average salary per game = 3000-5000 credits). You are paying a large chunk of your salary to destroy one tank, and the tank driver has to pay maybe 100-500.[EDIT 4]: One other thing. The game's matchmaking sometimes decides to match you in a game that is already almost over, meaning you will automatically be paid 0 credits.

People need to hold and push down (space)lanes acordingly, capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships.

If both blobs pick oposite lanes, whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice. If both blobs meet they fight, the blobs will then reform and repeat.

1995,5271,5275,Brawlhalla,"Very mixed feelings about this game. I still play it a lot, and it can still be fun to play casually, but if you ever decide to go into ranked and try to improve, there are some glaring problems in the game's mechanics that cannot go unnoticed.This game is not like Smash, in fact, Blue Mammoth Games tries as hard as possible to be different from Smash, so the mechanics are different and in a lot of ways, simpler. However, this does not mean the game does not take skill. In fact, I believe that Brawlhalla actually has a pretty decent skill ceiling.However, becoming better at the game isn't always fun, especially when you're nearing the top. You will soon realize that the punish game in Brawlhalla is ten times harder than Smash, and some legends/weapons in the game are downright annoying. Brawlhalla also utilizes a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block, and instead of grabbing, Brawlhalla requires you to read the opponent, and although there are reading patterns people tend to follow and moves that you can use to cover multiple dodge directions, the enemy still has 9 ways to dodge and 11+ ways to react.I don't know why, but I haven't exactly been able to bring myself to quit the game yet. I would always rage from ranked, but come back some other day, and I think it has to do with how accessible the game is. You can load up Brawlhalla and be in a ranked match playing a 1v1 in under a minute, no joke, making it a great game to play when you are short on time.TL;DR, very fun casual gameplay, aids ranked the higher you go, flawed mechanics, decent skill ceiling compared to Smash (although annoying to improve at), highly accessible when short on time.Also the lag holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥",1, mixed feelings game play lot fun play casually decide ranked try improve glaring problems game mechanics unnoticed game like smash fact blue mammoth games tries hard possible different smash mechanics different lot ways simpler mean game skill fact believe brawlhalla actually pretty decent skill ceiling better game fun especially nearing soon realize punish game brawlhalla times harder smash legends weapons game downright annoying brawlhalla utilizes dodge mechanic instead standard block instead grabbing brawlhalla requires read opponent reading patterns people tend follow moves use cover multiple dodge directions enemy ways dodge ways react know exactly able bring quit game rage ranked come day think accessible game load brawlhalla ranked match playing minute joke making great game play short time fun casual gameplay aids ranked higher flawed mechanics decent skill ceiling compared smash annoying improve highly accessible short time lag holy â

The free to play part you come in as a guest. you get basic clothes, basic weapons, and what you can hunt is limited. Back in the day we would call this a demo.

There are missions you can complete to earn game money, but that is only useful to by things you use up like attractant scents, first aid kits, etc. To buy weapons, you have to be a member. Then, you have to buy credits. With real cash. That part annoys me a bit. They should tell you up front that it will cost you cash to get the most out of the game. I do like the game; I've spent over 150 hours playing so far. The graphics are good. There are things I wish would be a bit better, such as being able to buy firearms and equipment from the money you earn through doing the missions. Not just through buying credits. Also, there are times you will shoot an animal, spend time tracking it, and it just... vanishes. Poof, gone. Or you will find it, but you can't recover it. Both have happened to me and they suck!

From what I understand the rooms that are not scripted are randomized and yield different results.The specimens were unique in their own ways, but they weren't too much of an issue once you understand how each work and can deal with them with rather ease.The stories that you learn throughout the game have no lasting appeal in the game, they happen and once you get past one it's over and is forgotten suddenly.Playing through the game by making it past 1000 rooms is not worth it, you're not rewarded with the endeavours you go through, it's basically just a non-standard game over anyway where you accomplish nothing, i.e., just a bad ending.On another note, it is indeed for free so you could give the game a go and see for yourself whether you'd like the game or not.

2006,3492,3495,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium.It is worth a buy? Yes. It is free to play at the time of review.Score: 8.5/10 (Current score in Early Access.)Score: 9/10 (Expected score when fully released.)Ring of Elysium, a Battle Royale, that has innovated and improved on this style of game successfully.The loot table is way better. Guns and ammo are easier to come by. Less circle luck. Air drops roll away. It has first person and third person. In third person you can press control and h to get first person view. = is autorun.You can't peak manually left and right around corners at moment, hopefully they add this ability soon. There is only an auto peak. Vehicle handling is excellent, cars have no fuel and you cant shoot out the tyres. You can split stacks of items in your inventory.Gun handling is excellent. More attachments can be kept on guns, can have three primary weapons. Attachments auto equip. Healing is less complicated and you can make more use of bandages to get back up to 100% health. Weather, lighting, graphics are awesome. Most building have realistic interiors rather than being empty. You can see your footsteps in the snow.Map, level design is excellent. The three abilities, snowboard, glide and climb add some strategy and make each round a new experience. Sound design is sublime, absolutely excellent. I was able to tell the direction of shots.Lots of potential when they add the new maps. Excellent launch, servers worked, games loaded quickly. you no longer have to jump out of plane, you can select a location on the map. Gets you into the interesting part much quicker. From some locations you can glide almost the entire map.There can be multiple winner from different teams. The helicopter end game allows a lot more freedom of movement. The helicopter end game works well, but they could easily implement a more traditional ending. The fact there is no circle makes the games harder to predict.You can't look around while running in fpp locked mode. Alt will not look around.If we have cosmetic items for sale I would rather be able to just buy what we want, than have random chance / luck loot boxes for sale that we pay for and still can't get what we want. I had high hopes for this game and it has exceeded them! Lots of potential, but in its current state it is much better than many finished games and this is only early access. They had to have the movement, the gunplay and release with a decent map for this early access and they have done that already and much more. This game is extremely fun.Why did the game not get 9.5/10. The following five features were missing at time of review in early access for me to give it 9.5/10. To developers, please add peaking manually / q and e buttons, shooting out tyres on vehicles, oceanic / australia, sydney dedicated servers, more maps to play on, ability to adjust voices, mute individuals, adjust car volume, gun reload sounds separately!Tested on a 1080Ti. 2080Ti had not released at time of review.A landmark game release.

2015,2310,2313,Path of Exile," It's alright, to be honest.  Not very noob friendly. Many mechanics are confusing or not properly explained and need a wiki search or two to understand. To piggyback on the previous point, some mechanics seem purposefully obscure.Can be difficult to know what your build needs to progress or get better, and may find yourself relying on the community for help.Art community is great, some people are helpful about builds on the Subreddit, the official forums are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ build guides are often inaccurate or misleading, and are ""updated for current patch,"" despite lacking promised content from leagues ago such as videos clearing bosses or else. Vouch threads are useless, as no negative comments can be made. Can't really trust anything especially considering the ToS, scammers usually get their way, and you don't. If you want to look good, be prepared to pay lots of money. Nearly all of the ingame items have terrible ingame art that doesn't adjust properly to character model and size, does not fit with any other armour and clips through most things. In fact, even the MTX that costs some 40-60 dollars will only fit with its own pieces, and no mind is paid about how it interacts with other MTX, or ingame items. Fashion is very hard, and very pricey. After 4 years, and still there is no ability to save a preset of your Hideout, so you may spend dozens of hours designing your 'home' and won't be able to carry it over to the new league.

2023,47,47,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,"Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out.",1, early access reviewspooky house jump scares worth time free review benchmark game pass worth money worth time play little experience horror genre spooky house jump scares pretty transparent premise plenty cute lighthearted moments jump scares thin thread plot goes deeper surface level rooms spend time wandering room room taking second repeated corridors enemies spaced interested bit underwhelming couple genuinely scary moments game charm want stick looking simple jump scares game covered interested horror game mechanics boiled scenario check
2024,11440,11444,Black Squad,"Early Access ReviewThis game is very fast paced and ""simple,"" in a good way. The sounds and the graphics are nice, the gameplay is quick and satisfying and honestly, it's nice to play Team Death Match again. With all the Battle Royal and Overwatch styled objective shooters trending, it's nice to turn off your mind for a bit and just shoot people. It really brings me back to the reason I started playing shooting games in the first place. Just fast paced gameplay where all you need to worry about is killing and being killed. I like that you can get all the guns without spending any money, though if you want to look cool with a skin, you might have to shell out quite a bit. The drop rate in the loot crates is god awful at the moment, I'm hoping the chances get better to give us at least a little hope.Also, not that important, but it would be cool to be able to make a few changes to your character model other than straight replacing it with acompletely different character. To get a little variety and personalization going.It's nice to have the choice to mute team/all chat for when you really just don't want to hear any of it. It gives players the change to say what they want in chat without bothering people who dont wan't to be involved in trash talk/offended, since they can just perma mute chats.Overall I have def. enjoyed the game so far and will continue playing long term most likely. Maybe one day I'll even be good at the game.",1, early access reviewthis game fast paced simple good way sounds graphics nice gameplay quick satisfying honestly nice play team death match battle royal overwatch styled objective shooters trending nice turn mind bit shoot people brings reason started playing shooting games place fast paced gameplay need worry killing killed like guns spending money want look cool skin shell bit drop rate loot crates god awful moment hoping chances better little hope important cool able changes character model straight replacing acompletely different character little variety personalization going nice choice mute team chat want hear gives players change want chat bothering people nt involved trash talk offended perma mute chats overall def enjoyed game far continue playing long term likely maybe day good game

2030,5155,5159,Brawlhalla,"Early Access ReviewWere you a big fan of the Super Smash series?You don't have a Nintendo console anymore?Well, this is the game for you buddy. It's free to play and absolutely not pay to win, only things you can really spend some of that money on is cosmetics or the ability to play some of your favorite legends whenever you want. It's reasonably small and easy to install and start playing with friends. You can start private lobbys, practice offline with bots to see the exact damage and hitboxes or you can prove what you're worth by stepping into matchmaking. You can try out different game modes, the usual beat 'em up, or something like brawlball. The game features daily missions that are kind of cool, though not really diverse. They reward you with a bunch of in game coins and nothing more. The game is balanced for as far as I can see, and doesn't really have OP characters and or moves. The community of the game is reasonably big, but not huge obviously.So to sum it all up, Pros:-Amazing feel and artwork.-Balanced enough.-Good diversity for alot of playtime.-FREE!-Small and easy to install.-Good community.-Good fun with friends.-Regularly updated and good interaction with the devs,Cons:-Lag in matchmaking can really screw up a game.-Not really alot of diversity between characters.Really don't have much bad to say about the game, but I will update this if I do.In my honest opinion, this is a great game, and nothing else.And it's free.

2034,13343,13347,Creativerse,"As someone who always needs an idea, and never knows how to get started when I do get one, I'm a fan of the blueprint system in this game. I like the challenge of gathering the materials for the build, and the customizability of the blocks in the blueprint doesn't limit my creativity. The abundace of recipes and blocks make it so you won't grow easily bored. When you're working on a build, or focused on terraforming the perfect spot for a build, it's really easy to get sucked into the game. Personally, I have a tendency to wander, so the map and touchstone/teleporters are great for when I (lacking any sense of direction) inevitably get lost. I've scattered projects across many biomes and I still haven't fully ""discovered"" the world in which I'm currently playing. Creativerse is a great game to play alone or (if you've got 'em) with friends. I started this game while it was in its early access stages and it's been great to see how much it's grown since then. That said, however, I do wish they would add more content to bring my friends back into the game, as I know they don't like that there's not much to do or see in the game lately.

2071,14504,14509,Robocraft,"Early Access ReviewI liked Robocraft when I played it about two years ago.Now I can say that I sorta hate it.Everything that was good about the game has been crushed and everything that was bad has gone worse.At the beginning we had a Tier System that differed experienced players from players that need help finding their own♥♥♥♥♥♥when they need to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥This is gone.Now we only have one tier - tier crap.I kinda grinded to the top level guns and the tier 10 cubes because I wanted to play with grown up individuals that now how to play and that took some time. Then the system was changed but i still had fun, sometimes.WIth the latest patch the game absolutely got destroyed. The crate-reward-model is pointless and P2W ... but I can't hardly see anyone pay money for this game because the matchmaking system is even worse than the new P2W model.What do I want from a game?To have fun!How do I have fun in a game?To compete with other individuals that match my skill in a fair enviroment and to play together with people that also match my skill.I want the game to be challenging and I want to be rewarded for my efforts to fight my team to victory.This is gone, it's all gone.The matchmaking system is extremely stupid and destroys the game in it's basic principles.So it's impossible to have a fair match because of people dropping out of teams and not getting replaced. Or the enemies team has like a four person squad that knows how to play and stomps you into the ground. Or the enemies team is just significantly better rolled.From ten matches I lose like seven and now to the worst thing, everytime I lose a rank aswell, that means, I can't get higher than silver ... thats where I start grinding my teeth. I would say, that I built a decent bot that has proven it's concept since the early alpha. I am always one of the three top players of my team. But I kinda always lose a rank because of the poor match making mechanics that suck me in an abyss and I have no chance to overcome that. Not by skill, not by effort.This makes the game not only pointless for me, it becomes a raging hell of frustration.I can not recommend this game to anyone who isn't a jerk or likes to feel eternal frustration.But heeeey the graphics look nice, the building system is very cool, the game types have a lot of potential.But this is worth nothing until the match making system has been fixed.I quit.

2096,2379,2382,Path of Exile,"PoE is the perfect example of RNG done very wrong, even for an ARPG.I still play for a little while after each expansion, but I always quit for months at a time waiting for the next, because they never fix the biggest problems with the core game.I only recommend it if you enjoy mindlessly grinding the same stale content for hundreds of hours to brute-force abysmal RNG while making no meaningful progress.This game has the potential to be amazing, but GGG's stubbornness about insane RNG-gated design coupled with the mentally ill community crying when somebody has too much fun will not let that potential be met.Progression is a chore. A ton of builds are not viable as the game continues to be balanced around the top 0.01% that have absolutely no life with min-maxed everything. Crafting gear you want is borderline impossible. Level 100 items can still get level 1 roll tiers. Countless build-enabling unique items are very inaccessible. Respeccing your passive skills is very expensive and this is exactly the kind of game where you want to be experimenting as much as possible with the passive tree. Trading is inconvenient and all manual. Most endgame content is gated behind pure RNG. No damage numbers, death logs or recaps in any way, which makes understanding what's going on significantly harder. Inconsistent enemy balance. Extremely overpriced MTX with no way to refund or trade in to get points back. It's impressive that GGG is able to put out big updates every few months, but they never fix the numerous core issues with the game, or they make them worse by balancing around no-life players. I could write a novel about what's wrong with this game from a design standpoint, but that's just more time wasted to PoE. If you want to do any endgame content without wasting countless hours, you'll most likely have to buy your way to it, which isn't how it should be designed at all.

2106,11860,11864,Bless Online,"tl;dr - The game is a classic MMORPG. Nothing new on the plate, nice graphics but horrible optimization regardless of build. You can take it as it is or pass on.I really wanted this game to be good, mainly because I've been starving for a good MMORPG for a while (silly me for looking at a game that recently turned f2p), but also because the lore intrigued me and, I'll admit it without shame, the graphics looked good. 30 seconds spent in the game and you'll see that yes, they do look good, but it also feels like you're constantly watching a Wallace & Gromit movie. The optimization is so poor that even people with top tier computer builds are having a hard time reaching 60 fps, let alone breaching that roof.Visuals aside (again, really good, but really choppy), the game does not appear to be anything new and it's... well, kinda boring. I know, I haven't played a lot BUT. BUT. A game should be entertaining from the get go, it shouldn't require you to put hours in just to have some fun. In all the time I played (short time, I know, but should be enough to have a gist of the mechanics) the only time I actually had fun was when I discovered that you can switch skills with the button "" ` "". That happened in the first 2 minutes. After that it's been... incredibly boring. Which is a shame, because the story sounds genuinely good and well crafted, but the story telling, even though there's a good amount of voice acting, is not gripping at all.Unfortunate.",0, game classic mmorpg new plate nice graphics horrible optimization regardless build pass wanted game good mainly starving good mmorpg silly looking game recently turned lore intrigued admit shame graphics looked good seconds spent game yes look good feels like constantly watching wallace gromit movie optimization poor people tier computer builds having hard time reaching fps let breaching roof visuals aside good choppy game appear new kinda boring know played lot game entertaining require hours fun time played short time know gist mechanics time actually fun discovered switch skills button happened minutes incredibly boring shame story sounds genuinely good crafted story telling good voice acting gripping unfortunate

2116,7208,7212,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"There are few people who have never heard of the Ancient Scrolls (The Elder Scrolls), every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans. Arena and Daggerfol for those who are older, Morrowind and Oblivion for those younger, and finally Skyrim for the youngest. All these games can be called cult, each introduced something of its own into the world of Elder Scrolls, what we brought the game The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, let's try to figure it out.Firstly, I do not agree that this game falls out of the general series, trampling on the canons of Scrolls. Yes, the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive, he is not elected, as was before, not Nerevarin and not Dovakin, but only one of thousands out of millions. This seems to hurt.Secondly, what do we have? All the same Nirn torn by the war and on the brink of death. Events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series, probably this fact also embarrasses many.Well, in the third, the changed game model, which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case.

2120,2338,2341,Path of Exile,"Been playing this game since 2014, little less than 4 years now, took a break during breach and prophecy league as I was playing other games. I never once doubted that GGG would keep developing a great game and trying it back during Closed beta, I knew that they would bring us an ARPG bringing us the D1 and D2 vibes that D3 failed to bring. Now sitting in 2018 I was glad I stuck with this game and supported them through buying supporter packs and mtx from the cash shop. For new players I believe that the games learning curve has gotten easier with the ammount of guides from the community and GGG's own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character. Although the curve to get into the game has gotten easier the challenge of earning currency, building a great character, and the endgame hasn't gotten any easier infact even harder. True POE has builds that make the game's content look like a joke and there will always be a meta, but the fun the game brings through running maps at endgame or simply leveling through acts 1-10 hasn't changed. I haven't always played on Steam as there was client issues in multiple leagues so my hours haven't all been on record but I will say I have atleast 3k+ total hours and counting in this game and plan on many more.If people are doubting whether the game is truly free to play look at other reviews, go into the game yourself or even just watch videos. The game is truly free, it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop is strictly cosmetic and convenience. What I do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game is catch the sales they have weekly and always buy on sale, they run multiple stash tab sales and you should only really buy when they are on sale unless you are 1st starting out. I highly recommend buying 1 currency tab, 1 quad tab, 1 map tab, and 1 premium tab. Essence, Divination, and Fragment tabs are pure convenience and really are only for those who truly want a tab for all the small things. If you cant spend 20$ on a game you can enjoy for hours at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you shouldn't be playing a f2p game at all.To close this wall of text, I recommend any new player who enjoys ARPG, and the d1 and d2 to try this game, if you are simply wanting to cure your itch for Lost Ark or whatever other new ARPG coming out in the future POE is a great way to do so. If you just simple enjoy ARPG and want a fair cash shop, crazy build customization, and hours of fun then download and start playing.",1, playing game little years took break breach prophecy league playing games doubted ggg developing great game trying closed beta knew bring arpg bringing vibes failed bring sitting glad stuck game supported buying supporter packs mtx cash shop new players believe games learning curve gotten easier ammount guides community ggg little tutorial beginning new character curve game gotten easier challenge earning currency building great character endgame gotten easier infact harder true poe builds game content look like joke meta fun game brings running maps endgame simply leveling acts changed played steam client issues multiple leagues hours record atleast total hours counting game plan people doubting game truly free play look reviews game watch videos game truly free bring advantage support cash shop strictly cosmetic convenience recommend player willing spend money game catch sales weekly buy sale run multiple stash tab sales buy sale starting highly recommend buying currency tab quad tab map tab premium tab essence divination fragment tabs pure convenience truly want tab small things nt spend game enjoy hours time comeback later find new content continue standard playing game close wall text recommend new player enjoys arpg try game simply wanting cure itch lost ark new arpg coming future poe great way simple enjoy arpg want fair cash shop crazy build customization hours fun download start playing

2122,16091,16096,Realm Grinder,"Frankly I don't even know why I play this game. Maybe because i am busy with work and it feels a bit better to have a game you can leave running without checkning at all, or even leave it offline. Feels like playing without playing.PROS- Compared to other clickers, it has more features catering to playing offline or AFK. Things like big production bonuses to offline play, and auto spell casting when you're away.- It has a lot of unlockable, long term. You will unlock things weekly for a very long time, possibly months or even years depending how much time you put into the game. (Frankly it's even too much, but that's how these type of games are.)- The concept of playing a being that reincarnates and can control multiple races is kind of interesting. And the mathematical optimisation is good exercise for the brain, if you're into that kind of min-maxing nerdy stuff.CONS- I would not advise anyone to play this for free. The gift of the heroes/kings/gods are kind of a must, else the restarting process at each abdications (which happen every few minutes sometimes) becomes way too time consuming.- Even with all the unlockable there is still missing a sens of progression. You can play for days without unlocking anything at all, which can feel super grindy and often tempting to give up on the game.- The descriptions are often vague, especially for trophies. Often there are specific conditions to the trophies that are required and not written, thus you can waste days trying to get a trophy one way before you realize something is missing through trial and error or asking on the forums. - The art could have been better. It's pixelated, but much better has been done in this style. Seeing the time you spend looking at the same screen and art, it can be improved greatly and quickly since the art assets are very few and fit on one screen.SHOULD YOU GET IT?As i said i don't even know why i am playing it. I could give up at any time. Do i recommend it? I don't think so. But since it's free, you can check it out for yourself and forge your own opinion.

2128,8399,8403,Neverwinter,"as i'm sitting here typing this i've loged in 31.7 gameplay hours. this game is fun. how is it fun? lets itemize a bit.lets start with the graphics. they clearly tell you what's going on, no problems. for those who place more importince on grahpics that i do: exelent specal effect displays that do not hamper the view of what's going on. easy to look at terrain and charcters, no eye sores here. what else do you peeps look for? dunno'game play, the combat (of wich there is plenty) is a bit more frantic than most mmo's i've played. you have to aim at your target, simply selecting it then pressing keyboard keys doesn't work, aim or you won't be able to hit with single target attacks, aoe attacks are easer to pull off, just make shure you are pointing in the correct direction. oh, and watch out for the big red areas, they show up when something hostile is about to land an attack there. about a dozen charcter races and (currently) 6 distinct classes. you get some tokens to rent a mount from a quest, let you know if you want to purchase one, or just keep walking. if you want to buy a mount there are an assortment of styles and speeds to choose from. and you can have a hierling, you get one of your choice free when you complete the tower zone, others can be purchased with ingame coin or (i assume) from the ingame store for real money.questing: the quests have decent varity and no confusion. read the quest discription, follow the provided waypoint. easy enough, as long as you can survive whatever gets thrown at you. if a new area is to hard, back up to your last zone and help peeps with there quests, another lvl or two makes a big difference and they will apreacate the help. or just run the dungeon a time or three more, this will also help peeps with their questing.sound? good. with 5.1 i have a good idea of everything going around me, on my comp screan or not. npc voiceovers are nicely done. combat noises are also nicely done. but this game is one of the very few i have problems with the voip, although i am apparently an exception here, as most i've talked to it works just fine for.crafting, what is an mmo without player crafted goods? at lvl 10 you can start crafting items from any of several professions. step one: hire a (free) assistant,the first one takes 5 sec, then have your assistant gather goods, refine gather goods, or make useable products. you can find crafting goods while out adventuring, this helps a bit. you start with one crafting work slot and get others by reaching various mile stones, wich you can read from the select a workslot space. you will probally will have the ""get a profession to lvl 3"" milestone first, and it doesn't take to long to get. somewhere in here i need to mention that when you make an item you have your assistant(s) work on it in real time. most tasks are in the neighhborhood of 10 to 15 min, some will take longer, however. when your hierling is done with the work, just collect the resule and (if you want to) have one of them start working on something else.community. in my exprience frendly peeps are the name of the game. need help, somebody will have a useful and polite answer in no time. friendly conversation is one of two topics i regulary see, the other is putting together a group for a quest.  gold farmers exist here, but just right click on their name, choose  ""report spam"" and they get put on your ignore list free of charge. no need to keep reading their spam. well, there was this one time i squelched somebody for rude coments to one of my toons, just right clicked and choose ignore for that person.i think this covers everything. oh ya, game is free to play, they appear to get their $ on optionals, other than needing to purchase everything indivudally. or paying for things that other games provide for free, i'm thinking about one you had to buy items with real world $ to speak in global. more charcter slots and keys for those lockboxes that get passed out like candy on hallowween are the only ones that i notice.

2129,7286,7290,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"A game I tried desperately to like and simply cant, Legends feels very much like a cash grab by Zenimax. Nearly bereft of innovation, Legends is a trading card game. Cards range from Common to Rare to Epic to Legendary (skipping Uncommon) because...that's how Hearthstone does it. Crafting costs are exactly the same as in that...other game...except for a slight discount on Legendary cards despite being able to play 3 times as many of them per deck, for the most part.Decks are 50 cards and playsets are 3 of for...reasons. Apparently, not ones related to either mathematics or common sense. Despite an additional 20 cards in the deck however, starting hands remain 3 cards. Because...well, you guessed it.For all its carbon copying of...that other popular card game...Legends does offer one interesting mechanic all its own (or, well, almost all, anyway): Lanes. In what is perhaps Legends singular fit of innovation, the board is split into two lanes. One lane plays normally, while the other grants minions Cover (Stealth from hearthstone, without the spell protection) for one turn. That the game utterly fails to capitalize on this single innovation should come as no surprise. Lanes exist. Some cards let you move minions from one lane to another. Which sometimes nets you...maybe +1/+1 or a card draw. For the most part, though, games will focus on whatever lane the first minion is played in while mostly ignoring the other, because lanes were a poorly thought out, poorly implemented and large pointless add-on, likely shoved in at some point because its vaguely similar to Gwent in some way on some marketing report somewhere.Couple this clumsy, poorly thought out, copy cat play design with a UI that is an insult to the eyes - half cloth fantasy map and half electric blue star trek lighting, laid latter atop the former - and the game is as painful to look at, as it is to play.My advice: Avoid this. Its clunky, poorly designed, poorly thought out and keeping up with new releases is quite expensive. So dont bother. Stick with card games that will still be here in 12-18 months.",0, game tried desperately like simply nt legends feels like cash grab zenimax nearly bereft innovation legends trading card game cards range common rare epic legendary skipping uncommon hearthstone crafting costs exactly game slight discount legendary cards despite able play times deck decks cards playsets reasons apparently ones related mathematics common sense despite additional cards deck starting hands remain cards guessed carbon copying popular card game legends offer interesting mechanic lanes legends singular fit innovation board split lanes lane plays normally grants minions cover stealth hearthstone spell protection turn game utterly fails capitalize single innovation come surprise lanes exist cards let minions lane nets maybe card draw games focus lane minion played ignoring lanes poorly thought poorly implemented large pointless add likely shoved point vaguely similar gwent way marketing report couple clumsy poorly thought copy cat play design ui insult eyes half cloth fantasy map half electric blue star trek lighting laid atop game painful look play advice avoid clunky poorly designed poorly thought keeping new releases expensive nt bother stick card games months

2158,2121,2124,Path of Exile,"This is my absolute favorite ARPG to play. I loved Diablo 2. This game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique Diablo 2 / Titan Quest ARPG. The RNG is real, the challanges are fun. The content doesn't get dull. Progression is limitless. Knowledge is never ending. Mechanics are so well done. The skills in this game are interesting. The ability to MAKE ANY BUILD you want is just simply the greatest. My cons: Poor optimization, an SSD and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable FPS.The highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. It's doable but likely expensive for solo players. Not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.There is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new Lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. The lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't  gamebreaking unless you have a bad PC.Overall, if you've never played an APRG like this before, it make come off as too hard. The hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. What items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. All of this stuff simply takes TIME to understand. I've played this game since closed beta, on and off. I learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.This game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. This game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. This game is SUPER competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. Racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.The content updates are constant, the gaming company, Grinding Gear Games are simply the best of the best. On par with Valve and sorta kinda Blizzard-8-years-ago. There are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.If you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. But you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. This is always the biggest issue I see with new players. This is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.Don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to Diablo 3. It isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. Make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.If you're my friend, hit me up, I will do everything I can to make you realize this game. It's fun, I love it. Oh and it's 100% free to play. There is no pay to win. Extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. That said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab.

Yeah it still needs much work to become a game that will hold its people but the devs are moving to the right direction, ALWAYS hearing what the players say.

2174,10450,10454,theHunter Classic,Ok so after a few hours playing this game i can honestly say i really liked it. The negative reviews are people crying because they expect something for nothing. This is F2P i have been for some time now. Every week the animals you can hunt are rotated you also start with two guns and five types of ammo which can deal with most of the creatures. Yes there is a lot of things to buy in the game but you are not being forced to and you earn in game money for your kills. My personal advice would be to get a 12 month mebership which i think is £30 and with that you get so much extra stuff plus the right to hunt what ever you like. So if your into your hunting give it a try and see for yourself.,1, ok hours playing game honestly liked negative reviews people crying expect time week animals hunt rotated start guns types ammo deal creatures yes lot things buy game forced earn game money kills personal advice month mebership think extra stuff plus right hunt like hunting try
2175,7814,7818,Trove,"Another instance of Trion moneygrubbing the community. When this came to steam, I got as many friends as I could to play(Not because I tried it yet, but because the concept was enticing). We grinded up to max by doing as much as we could, got a few of the other classes, and all around was just having a good time. We stopped playing and a few months ago (when dragons came out), I gave the game a look and found that I could simply buy a dragon and not have to do the -extensive- grinding. I quit after wasting much time attempting to grind the mats.Then, recently, I looked over the game again; having in the past known it was good, and hoping more that the developers fixed the grind-to-pay ratio. I learned, sadly, it just got worse. I once did recommend this game, but as Trion goes, their games don't last long. It sucks, this almost made it to the front page on 'Most Popular'.",0, instance trion moneygrubbing community came steam got friends tried concept enticing grinded max got classes having good time stopped playing months ago dragons came gave game look found simply buy dragon grinding quit wasting time attempting grind mats recently looked game having past known good hoping developers fixed grind pay ratio learned sadly got worse recommend game trion goes games long sucks page popular
2176,4237,4241,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,"First off, why did Steam allow a mobile game onto their store? Just because it is popular? You have no reason to get this port. Just get it for your phone, if only it was a good game.This game's only gimmick is that it is the original format. No synchros. No Xyz's. No pendulums. Just the OG cards, except the fact that Konami had to put in newer cards into the game in order to boost consistency and support. Also you only have 3 monster card zones and 3 spell/trap card zones, which makes some cards and archtypes, like Dark Scorpions, unplayable. Speaking of cards, where are the good cards? 80% of the cards are pack filler garbage, 15% are decent, 4.9% are good, and 01.% are great. Also, some cards from the OG format are gone for some reason. Most of the Element Hero fusions aren't there, some Gladiator Beast are missing, and there are only TWO MONARCHS. And the reason for why the monarchs are gone is the main reason of why this game sucks. The OG format sucks. Almost all of the cards suck and the concept of archtypes was still being figured out so consistency and support is nonexistent.Synchros, Xyz's, pendulums, and even link summoning was far better than the OG format. Each one helped evolve Yu-Gi-Oh into a better game, except maybe link summoning. Sychros made the extra deck actually worth having, Xyz's sped the game up and allowed easy access to the extra deck, pendulums allowed better swarming, and link summoning helped counter OP extra deck spammers. What did the OG have? A lot of crappy fusions that aren't worth running and ritual monsters that only where relevant due to two ritual archtypes that came out after the OG format. Literally the only reason that you would play this game is for nostalgia. And Nostalgia is the only thing that will carry you through this game.If you understand this game even a little, you will became to OP for NPC's in no time. You will mow through them so efficiently that not auto-dueling will become torture really fast. In 24 hours, I was almost able to collect all the cards available for one box set of cards that had 600 total cards in it, with the amount of cards you get with each pack being only three measly cards. It only took me around 30 packs to make a deck that was so good that I have to brick in order for my opponent to have a chance to beat me. As for keeping you coming back to the game, the game offers pathetic events and the fact that every ""energy"" bar, that are the staple for long mobile games like this, fills up really quickly that you have no choice but to keep playing which is bad for games like this. The reason the ""energy"" bar exists is to keep gameplay in quick, short burst and prevent burn out. If a mobile game forces you to sit down and empty your battery, it goes against the entire point of a mobile game.Finally, another big problem with this game are the skills. To keep things simple, the skills allow you to cheat and make the game even easier. Skills have appeal because it makes you feel like your playing like they do in the anime, but let it sink in that everyone in the original seasons cheats and the anime had to make up cards and edit existing cards in order to allow the heores win with their terrible decks. Granted you don't have to use skills, unless you want to play against other players. Speaking of which, how is playing against other players? Not that good. The more you face off against higher level players, the more you start seeing the same cards over and over again.Is this game good? No! Is this game at least playable? Yes, but not for long. There are far better Yu-Gi-Oh games that you could be playing instead that play this is down right stupid. Just play one of the console, handheld, the actual card game, or buy and play Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist on Steam.3/10 Would never want to play this game ever again.",0, steam allow mobile game store popular reason port phone good game game gimmick original format synchros xyz pendulums og cards fact konami newer cards game order boost consistency support monster card zones spell trap card zones makes cards archtypes like dark scorpions unplayable speaking cards good cards cards pack filler garbage decent good great cards og format gone reason element hero fusions gladiator beast missing monarchs reason monarchs gone main reason game sucks og format sucks cards suck concept archtypes figured consistency support nonexistent synchros xyz pendulums link summoning far better og format helped evolve yu gi oh better game maybe link summoning sychros extra deck actually worth having xyz sped game allowed easy access extra deck pendulums allowed better swarming link summoning helped counter op extra deck spammers og lot crappy fusions worth running ritual monsters relevant ritual archtypes came og format literally reason play game nostalgia nostalgia thing carry game understand game little op npc time mow efficiently auto dueling torture fast hours able collect cards available box set cards total cards cards pack measly cards took packs deck good brick order opponent chance beat keeping coming game game offers pathetic events fact energy bar staple long mobile games like fills quickly choice playing bad games like reason energy bar exists gameplay quick short burst prevent burn mobile game forces sit battery goes entire point mobile game finally big problem game skills things simple skills allow cheat game easier skills appeal makes feel like playing like anime let sink original seasons cheats anime cards edit existing cards order allow heores win terrible decks granted use skills want play players speaking playing players good face higher level players start seeing cards game good game playable yes long far better yu gi oh games playing instead play right stupid play console handheld actual card game buy play yu gi oh legacy duelist want play game

Getting 60-90 fps with my current setup.-Ok balance between classes.~needs a bit more tweeking~-Good overall selection of ships and skins.-Love the EXP and credits mechanics, which were nonexistent when I quit before.Con's: -Missing skins, What happened to the Ghost G-Type skin? Its missing from my invintory and know I had it before I lost interest in the game. Edit: Seems I was mistaken, I did not realize that there were two versions of the Ghost, one being the premium ship I got from Vangard and the one that you have to gain EXP to get which I believe would have the skin I thought was missing.-All I seem to ever get are EU servers, thought by now they would have implemented US servers or ones that are closerto the US for the sake of lag reduction for US based players, Honestly this is one of the reasons I quit the last time, No way this is on my end seeing as I have a custom gaming rig and over 60 meg line, plus, I have seen alot of complaints from other people about this in chat since I started to play again, really, fix this soon or you may loose more people again.-Price point. Price is perfect, IF and only IF the server issue gets fixed. Either faster server net speed or add US servers.-From what I can tell no way to make a 'Platoon of more than 2' in a group, I could be wrong since I havent invited anyone to the game.-Practice / Test area vs dumb AI to test a ship would be nice, which I would have thought would have been placed in this game, and the way the key layout is, would be nice to have this to test a rebind of keys on a ship.-Random Matchmaking throws me off a bit, I remember ability to create servers and and remeber the servers identifying as EU or US based off the host.----------------------------Not really a Con, Dev killed me.

2192,1045,1048,Fractured Space,"Early Access ReviewLove this game! -Diverse ships: each has a type of ship it is really good against and a ship type it is really bad against (based off of one-on-one) and as the game keeps being developed more ships are added with different load-out options (usually a standard, faster firing speed but lower damage, and a high damage but lower firing speed).-Each battle is different: every ship has a counter and a ship to compliment it. For examble; most small ships can be taken out by a Colossus, but a Destroyer or Reaper can tear through a Colossus' armor and destroy it. -The game is very basic after you play a couple times: The controls are easy to learn, all your ship functions are layed out for you in the order that the abilities are on the keyboard/mouse, and after a match or two you begin to understand the role of what your ship is and how it fits into how to make your team the victor. Each ship has different abilities, roles, speeds, and differences which can help win an engagement.-They actively update it.

For example, sometimes my friends and I have to restart our client to get a match or the match would be aborted.

2209,8836,8840,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewI've not been real big into the battle royale craze. I played PUBG a bit, but it's always been riddled with bugs, and I barely touched Fortnite and think the building aspect is a neat twist, if a bit gimmicky. But I saw Realm Royale and had to give it a shot because it looked interesting.Now I know it's painfully obvious Hi-Rez is always trying to jump on the bandwagon, but this is actually a really solid (albeit needing a bit more polish) game.Good points:*Matchmaking is really quick. Southeast Asia, where I'm located, is a bit slower at about a minute wait, but the American server takes no time at all.*The classes are really cool and all seem viable. They are unique in having access to different abilities and legendary weapons.*The map is wonderfully varied with different biomes.*Finding loot is always worth it even if the stuff is worse than what you have, since you can break them down into Shards used for crafting at a forge. Also really addicting to loot and find better armor, weapons, and abilities.*The Forges are GREAT. The highest quality gear you can find in the world are Epic, with legendary gear needing to be crafted at these locations using Shards (and even a player elimination for the class specific legendary weapon). The crafting process takes time and smoke can be seen when a forge is being used, so these locations can be highly contested as other players will want to take the loot for themselves!*Chickens. You turn into a chicken when you are ""knocked out"" and can run and jump. If you aren't killed within 30 seconds of being a chicken, you will revive yourself. This works even in solo, and it's fantastic.Negative points*Bit of lag at the beginning of matches.*Some weapons need tweaking/nerfed/buffed. The hunter's bow has a ridiculous hit box, for example.*The sound effects are... bad. The sword swing sound is ridiculously stupid and loud. The best song in the game plays when you're a chicken, but I muted music audio entirely because the game music plays for like a minute after landing in the world and it makes it hard to hear other players.*General polish needed. Character animations look awkward, some floating trees, etc.All in all, I'm impressed with how fun and addicting this game is. It changes the formula by being class based, involving a little more teamwork in that regard, being generous with health/armor, and most of all by the Shards and Forge crafting system which is just brilliant.

2215,8125,8129,Neverwinter,"I guess I should review this game after 500+ hours. This is my first MMORPG I've ever played so I won't be comparing it at all.I've dropped out of this game a few times and would go without questing or advancing in the story line because of repetition. All dungeons and maps seem similar on arrival: Someone wants you to kill ## of a certain enemy, someone wants you to grab/drop off ## items, enemies are grouped together and charge at you as soon as you're in range. This has been my biggest and maybe only complaint.The story line is vast and can emerse or bore players. I've enjoyed fantasy novels and films, so this was my interactive form of one. The stories of Neverwinter continue to build, so as the developers release modules, there'll be quests and campaigns to engage in. Within the stories there is both humour and seriousness, which I appreciated. The campaigns have brought me back into the game often.The environments are diverse and beautiful. There is a lot of work put into the development of maps. Although not open world, they're still big and wonderful to walkthrough.Level building is easy and is now capped at 70, which was a good move to keep players sticking around later. I was dissapointed I skipped entire storylines because the levelling up was not aligned with the maps I was on, which made them too easy to walkthrough and pretty uninteresting. The campaigns opened at level 70 are challenging, as well as the PVP and and other PVE quests.Yes, there are payment options in game, but it would not necessarily be pay-to-win because a lot of the items are more aestetic or can be purchased through in-game money. I would recommend putting some investment into the game, especially when the workers at the publishing and developing companies do put a lot of serious and good work into adding on to the game and supporting players through it.I don't know much about the social or community aspect, but with the new Strongholds module, there is more engagement with guilds in the game.

The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game    ",1, sorry bad english gamer played played world tanks game hidden gems world gaming usuall fps strike team fortress like rating game good game want gave low rating cause new patch messed lot tier playing progress good plane new patch m late tier german aviaton planes tier plane tier plane outgunned outpowerd outtactic lost interest german planes new played notice years playing notice long time good plane graphics game unbelieveable texture detail ground amazing need golden game pretty high im british planes tier struggling game credits m ending bankcrupt fear high tier gaming need higher currency premium play loss game matchmaking worst review new tier system making lot pro players tier new players tier unbalanced considering russian tier planes good new players nt like challenging pro players pretty dominates pro players positive hacker saw low tier ripped wing armored mitchell seconds firing match making system worst war thunder overall game perfect players bored ordinary person shooter game high graphic picture pay win game

2224,11698,11702,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewDON'T BUY, IT'S A CASHGRAB!! DON'T BUY, IT'S A CASHGRAB!! DON'T BUY, IT'S A CASHGRAB!! It's exactly as awful as most of the reviews let you think.Servers we're locked during launch and a lot people are separated from their guilds/friends and there is no planned character transfer announced in near future (and if there will be, im pretty scared that it's €€€€ only). There is currently only 1 server in EU (locked one at launch) that actually has the amount of players that i wouldn't call it as dead server, and yeah its 1 week from launch. So basically they closed the only server worth putting any time in to and forced us to the RU/DE/FR speaking servers without any population. (I did count 7 people in main city last night, while there was 50-100 people on server Physis.Leveling experience is so selfrepeating and mind numbing, that if you made an mistake and leveled up in another server because of server lock, you definetly don't wanna repeat that process again and level up 2nd character in another server, just to save couple days of your life and your mental health. Most likely missing all of it's endgame content. We got patch, 15v15 bg (you only can queue specific timeframes 3x 1 hour per day, and on dead server you have to be very lucky to get queue pop before timeframe closes. (Basically you get 3 battlegrounds in a day, if you want to put alarm for all those 3 timewindows when queue is possible and get in to bg before it closes) It got ruined day after by placing ONE SHOTTING PVE mobs in there, and all your runes in your gear break if you die in pve, so.... WHO THE F GOT THE IDEA TO DO SO.Item duplication bug at launch (they told the duped items are removed) we have a lot of proof those aren't. Currently a bug where you can do insane amounts of money just by running a circle and pressing 1 button.Anyways, dev's have been trying hard and been giving us a lot ""fix"" patches during the first week from launch. Apparently those seems most likely to be randomly tweaked parameters and completely untested before pushing those to official servers. Some of those been good, some of those changes mess up the game even more.From many places I hear; ""all those negative reviews are from players under 2 hours in game, they can't tell truth and just want to bash the game"";I took 1 week, put in 100 hours, and i don't see any wrong in those negative reviews. Some people just recognize a cash grab/TOO broken game faster than the others.Refundtrain is far gone already, so don't take risk.Honest review from somebody, who does put 10+ hours every day on mmorpg s: 0/10Update: They are about to do server merge, for those who had been forced to dead servers and later on leveled another faction character in other server, sadly they will disable another faction chars instead of giving us a possibility to faction change.DON'T BUY, IT'S A CASHGRAB!!

2230,13659,13663,Creativerse,"Creativerse enters the released game genere with a positive review by me.While some still are bemoaning the 'Pro' upgrade, they have to remember that about 80% of the craftable content IS free to play with this game. Many of their reviews show evidence that they lack an understanding on how the crafting system, recipies, and blueprints work. It takes more than an hour or two of gameplay to understand these things fully!With that said, I want to talk about the Blueprints that are also availible. Many totally misunderstand this part of the game and see the 'coin' pricetag but miss how to get nearly all the blueprints for free! The pricetag is only if you want ALL the blocks NOW. What this means is if you craft the corner stone for the blueprint and place it where you want the structure, the blueprint WILL walk you through building it. All you have to do is collect the resources, make the blocks, then place them where the blueprint tells you to place it. FREE! While there are still a few bugs in the blueprint system, such as blocks being required to face in wrong directions, the devs are aware of this and are working to correct this on a blueprint by blueprint update. Hopefully it gets finished soon though they are more focusing on game bugs in the code than a misdirected block in a free blueprint (understandably).At the heart of this game, unlike the similar Minecraft game, Creativerse takes place on an online server so Internet IS required to play this game. In the free version you are limited in the features and number of personal worlds you create. This is understandable due to server space equates to money. The Pro upgrade gives you more control and additional worlds you can create. That being said, if you want your world to be private and for you only, you can set it as such and even password it so only you can enter it. Once the password has been entered ONCE it doesn't need to be entered again from my experiance. You can make it just as easy a private 'server' world where only you and your friends have access or a public one that any can join.A newer feature in Creativers that I have yet to explore so will be very brief on is the ability to build and share adventures along with having rewards for those who visit and review it. While having not made any yet to share, this feature does show promise and eventually I will jump into this part and update my review when I have.In building your world, you can claim land to keep others (friends or foes) from altering the area you are building in. This includes blowing things up with explosives. Pro players have extra 'free' claims per world and more flexability to the rules they sit compared to the free to play players. One of a few nice incentives to purchase the Pro DLC.The building part of the world seems a little clumbsy and confusing at first but once you learn how the crafting system works it becomes really easy and fast. Just keep at it, keep unlocking block recipies by building blocks and you will get the hang of it! It will take more than an hour or two for you to get the hang of things on your first time playing. Aslo expect to die from silly things until you gain an understanding on the mechanics. If you have played Minecraft, this part is a little more confusing where as all recpies are known you just figure them out. In Creativers, you must learn how to construct from the recipies and unlock the locked ones by building other recipies that come before. Such as, what is needed for an iron door is unknown until you first build the wooden door. This is where many who have negitive reviews are getting confused with what is 'free' and 'pro'. Remember, just because it is locked doesn't mean it isn't free. It simply means it must be learned. Some recipies the only way to learn them is to find them in a chest or a drop! Less than 20% of the availible recpies must be purchased with coins and those are mostly cosmetic. Also, do note that SOME recipies are only availible during specific events such as Halloween and Christmas! Additionally, there are a few limited time recipies from the store! (Grab those free ones while you can!)Next, the graphic detail of the game is great in my opinion! It reminds me of Minecraft but with a mod to give the game the HD textures. The gameplay is reminescent of Minecraft (for those of use who played it) but I feel it is a touch easier to play. I do miss the mods, but I suspect in time mods will become availible and possibly incuraged. However, I do not foresee this as something soon due to how this game works at the core.Some also bemoan the 'Pro' upgrade when it came out due to those features were in the early access free while under  testing were moved into the 'Pro' feature. After doing some hunting in the forums it was pointed out that these were being added free so they had a large player base to find bugs and correct them before Pro was released. Remember people, it was early access and availible so they could TEST the feature before they made people pay money for them. And really, the game is FULLY playbale without the glider (fun and somewhat useful) and you simply need to manage your inventory without the added 2x space in your backpack. You can also get by without buying additional land plots and the free to play worlds are just as usable as the pro worlds. The lack of Pro features are NOT game breaking considering the game is mostly centered around teamwork and NOT compitition. Competing with each other was the last thing on the Dev's mind when Pro was released and it really gives marginal advantage if people ARE competing. With all that being said, the game gets a huge thumb up from me and I look forward to the new content as it comes out!",1, creativerse enters released game genere positive review bemoaning pro upgrade remember craftable content free play game reviews evidence lack understanding crafting system recipies blueprints work takes hour gameplay understand things said want talk blueprints availible totally misunderstand game coin pricetag miss nearly blueprints free pricetag want blocks means craft corner stone blueprint place want structure blueprint walk building collect resources blocks place blueprint tells place free bugs blueprint system blocks required face wrong directions devs aware working correct blueprint blueprint update hopefully gets finished soon focusing game bugs code misdirected block free blueprint heart game unlike similar minecraft game creativerse takes place online server internet required play game free version limited features number personal worlds create understandable server space equates money pro upgrade gives control additional worlds create said want world private set password enter password entered need entered experiance easy private server world friends access public join newer feature creativers explore brief ability build share adventures having rewards visit review having share feature promise eventually jump update review building world claim land friends foes altering area building includes blowing things explosives pro players extra free claims world flexability rules sit compared free play players nice incentives purchase pro building world little clumbsy confusing learn crafting system works easy fast unlocking block recipies building blocks hang hour hang things time playing aslo expect die silly things gain understanding mechanics played minecraft little confusing recpies known figure creativers learn construct recipies unlock locked ones building recipies come needed iron door unknown build wooden door negitive reviews getting confused free pro remember locked mean free simply means learned recipies way learn find chest drop availible recpies purchased coins cosmetic note recipies availible specific events halloween christmas additionally limited time recipies store grab free ones graphic detail game great opinion reminds minecraft mod game hd textures gameplay reminescent minecraft use played feel touch easier play miss mods suspect time mods availible possibly incuraged foresee soon game works core bemoan pro upgrade came features early access free testing moved pro feature hunting forums pointed added free large player base find bugs correct pro released remember people early access availible test feature people pay money game fully playbale glider fun somewhat useful simply need manage inventory added space backpack buying additional land plots free play worlds usable pro worlds lack pro features game breaking considering game centered teamwork compitition competing thing dev mind pro released gives marginal advantage people competing said game gets huge thumb look forward new content comes

2236,2223,2226,Path of Exile,"Easily the best game of the genre. Easily amongst the greatest F2P models. Easily the most deep and creative ways to build your character. Easily a must-play for everyone.Pros- FANTASTIC free to play model. You get the entire game right off the bat. There's really no 'except' or 'but' to this, you seriously just straight up get the entirety of the game. All the things you can spend $ on are things such as cosmetics for your character, pets, decorative set pieces for your hideout, and other petty stuff along those lines.- The game features perhaps the deepest way to create a character's build in video gaming history. You see, the game has a passives tree with over 1,000 nodes to invest in. The class you pick merely determines where in the tree you'll start. For example, The Duelist class starts on the bottom, where strength and dexterity meet.  Here is a picture [i.imgur.com] of the current passives tree. This massive tree combined with the strange way you mix skill gems with support gems to bend your spells to do exatecly what you want. For example, you can attach a fireball (skill gem) with Lesser Multiple Projectiles (a support gem). Now instead of 1 fireball, you now shoot 3. Or perhaps you want to summon a totem to shoot the fireballs for you? Or maybe your fireballs fork into two more fireballs when they hit an enemy. On top of that, ""unique"" items in the game can bend the normal rules for your character, to allow for even more creativity and possibilites present. - Three month leagues with special rules or permanent leagues. A multitude of various races to start a character at level 1 and reach the furthest in the game in a certain time under certain rules running every day. Softcore or hardcore. There's a lot of variety present in the game which is sure to find your niche.- Amazing developers deliver content on the regular. I took a break from the game (after about 1,200 hours) for 3 months and when I came back there were 14 new support gems, 7 new skills, a new master system, personal hideouts, and more bugfixes/quality of life changes than I cared to read in one session.

2253,6769,6773,Heroes & Generals,"Early Access ReviewBesides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something (Or you could just spend real money to buy it... because its THAT kinda game!), I would have to say this game sucks. From the ""realistic"" gameplay, the completely ""balanced"" factions, or maybe the ""realtime"" wars that players influence, I would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says!Lets start with the free to play part! It, as stated above, can take upto weeks just to get enough money and XP to buy a weapon. However! If you think that you're above this, and don't want to wait, you can just spend the ~10 US dollars to buy it right there and then. (Buying it with credits even allows you to COMPLETELY skip over the XP requirements, along with the money!)Then comes the ""realistic"" and ""Simulation"" battles- IF one could call them that! I believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model, which although had some nice hopes... is for lack of better words, sh*t. Many a times I have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas, when I get into a firefight with another soldier. Mid shooting, my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isn't in position (Because APPARENTLY my gun was running into some invisible force?) for firing. Then theres the maps... Oh! how I hate ALL of the maps. From large open areas with almost no cover from base to base, to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful, or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog? All in all, the maps aren't that great either, simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game.After that, there goes the ""balance"" which just as everything before is little but existent. I'd like to paint a little picture for you here... American Bombing Planes: 2 bombsGerman Bombing Planes: 1 bombSoviet Bombing Planes: 4 bombs! (Kinda crazy right?)But, the German plane must have SOME redeeming qualities right? Like better mobility, or stronger bullets? Nope, its the exact same as the other, if not worse. After the planes comes the tanks and weapons. (I'd like to just say real quick, Germany is EASILY the most underpowered, and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better, or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the Soviets into the game, which look to have the best weapons.) From the poor guns of the German, to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the American weapons, to the overly good starting Soviet guns, its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction WELL over others. Tanks/vehicles, while pretty well balanced, are VERY overpriced, and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction. All in all, the game's balance seems to be lacking, and its actually rather annoying to see the devs. favor some factions over others...Those ""real-time"" wars you were expecting? Or that ""huge scale"" battles that you thought you were going to get? Wrong again! While yes, there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on, and are ranked, most battles are only 16 V 16. This looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the ""class variety"" that the game has, leading to searching for game up to 10 minutes (And thats without a squad... being in a squad can take AGES). Finally, after getting into a game, you may notice that THE WHOLE SERVER consist of just THAT class, or very few other... You can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay, and overly long searching time for a game that it may 'plop' you in, which ends roughly a minute after your joining! (Also, I'm not really going to approach the whole, campaign thing, as its seems to literally be pointless. Wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction... but you can almost always bet the Germans lose, even when they win?)All in all, this game really in a trainwreck, that yes, I have had SOME fun playing, needs A LOT (and I cant stress enough how much I mean that) of work. Also, before you say, ""Oh well you've spent almost 100 hours playing the game, it MUST be good!""

2268,12167,12171,Bless Online,"Early Access ReviewWell, at first, I loved this game.  I felt the combat was fun and impactful and it is a good looking game.  Then they made an across the board nerf dropping our attack by 50+% making trash mob grinding a chore.  That should not be the case in an MMORPG.  Most of the fun comes from end-game content where the content is scaled to whatever power curve players are enjoying.  They said they didn't know we would be this powerful ... how is this possible?  Did they not test the game at all before release? I mean, combat was a major emphasis of their development over the past year!  How could they not know?  They said the nerf was mostly for PvP, but in so doing they broke PvE.  I personally doubt that they did not know,  but rather I believe this was a move to make the leveling process longer since most end-game content was (unbelievabley) removed just before release.  They didn't want a huge number of players at end-game with nothing to do.  So I really feel like I was a victim of a bait-and-switch here.  Those of us who took a little time to try several different classes and check out crafting ... we are screwed.  Those that head long leveled to cap in 2 days ... they are golden.  And before the Bless zealots tell me to ""get good"" & ""learn my class"",    I could still solo the 22 dungeon @ level 24 (skipping the bird & anaconda),    I know about & use stance swapping for the associated buffs they provide,    and I very rarely die.  That being said, its just not fun & I cannot recommend it at this time.   I do hold out some glimmer of hope, since they have stated that more skill balancing is needed.  Hopefully, they address the grindfest they have turned the game into (man, I worked for a living I dont want my games to be another job).  Also, end-game content will be added to the game.  If they addressed these two issues, I might be able to recommend it.    Its a beautiful game with potential.  Just potential unfulfilled at this time.On further reflection & entering the game for less than 5 minutes today ... I realized I really don't want to play this in its current state.

2295,9048,9052,PlanetSide 2,"Construction is stupid, new weapons are broken, implants are broken, new server was handled poorly. Older development team was better. BRING BACK LORD HIGBYLet's get one thing very clear first and for most, jumping into this once excellent game, it's gonna be filled with fully decked out veterans on every front. So expect to die A LOT within the first few hours of playing this game, no matter where you go. However, it still fails to quell the satisfaction of saying 100s of players a side trying to duke it out over a single capture point for the deciding base in an alert, which could turn the odds of winning in exponentially in your favour.However, this game is far from its glory days of the past, where I feel that questionable design decisions have been made in order to ""improve"" this game. I've been playing this game ever since its launch and I have seen how this game has grown under both in population and in standard under its previous developer SOE. During this period, it truly felt like this game could be something unique. The ambitions of the old development team were high as they pushed out new weapons and a new continent as well as the user cosmetic system. I have seen my old server, Briggs, grow from just a few hundred players a night, to well over a few thousand, all occasionally clashing in on one base simultaneously. It was during this period, where for me, even dying a hundred times over made the game experience a lot more endearing.Once the new team, Daybreak, took over however, the game was quite literally flipped on its head. With the old team, you could feel that they were trying to make a good game, but the new team just feels like they are trying to make a quick buck. First off, with the current construction system, it feels a lot like just filler content for the rich and ""real-money spenders"" to get a couple of kills with a nuke, compared to when it was used as tactical objectives. The nuke never really contributes anything tactically towards turning a battle in your favor, other than holding the enemy back for a brief period. Next, with the introduction of the newer NS weapons, WHICH ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN FACTION SPECIFIC WEAPONS, its giving people more incentive to not use their faction specific weapons and playstyles anymore, as anyone who does is basically♥♥♥♥♥♥on by an NS weapon. Third, the current state of the implant system is basically broken right now, as there are only 2 REAL IMPLANTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY USEFUL in the current meta. If you don't have either of those or you aren't a heavy, you're basically out of luck in almost every one on one. The worst part is that you can buy implants with REAL WORLD MONEY, which gives 12 year old rich cry babies the ability to go on killing sprees without having to do much prior work!!!The one thing I can commend the new developers for is the introduction of the newer server for the Asian region, allowing a large proportion of their players an opportunity to play at a lower latency. With the introduction of this server, they gave veterans the opportunity to transfer their characters to SolTech, ALL EXCEPT BRIGGS. So, those of us who have dedicated thousands of hours on Briggs, had to basically kiss our progress goodbye!!!The culmination of all these design decisions on behalf of Daybreak, have driven quite a few of its veterans away, almost 7 8ths of a server population in some cases. Plus, it fails to give newer players an incentive to keep playing this game. Add that to an outdated, soon to be updated (hopefully), graphics engine, I could potentially see this game, which still has so much potential, eventually dying out before it has a chance to fluorish.",0, construction stupid new weapons broken implants broken new server handled poorly older development team better bring lord higbylet thing clear jumping excellent game gon na filled fully decked veterans expect die lot hours playing game matter fails quell satisfaction saying players trying duke single capture point deciding base alert turn odds winning exponentially favour game far glory days past feel questionable design decisions order improve game playing game launch seen game grown population standard previous developer soe period truly felt like game unique ambitions old development team high pushed new weapons new continent user cosmetic system seen old server briggs grow players night thousand occasionally clashing base simultaneously period dying times game experience lot endearing new team daybreak took game literally flipped head old team feel trying good game new team feels like trying quick buck current construction system feels lot like filler content rich real money spenders couple kills nuke compared tactical objectives nuke contributes tactically turning battle favor holding enemy brief period introduction newer ns weapons powerful faction specific weapons giving people incentive use faction specific weapons playstyles anymore basically ns weapon current state implant system basically broken right real implants actually useful current meta heavy basically luck worst buy implants real world money gives year old rich cry babies ability killing sprees having prior thing commend new developers introduction newer server asian region allowing large proportion players opportunity play lower latency introduction server gave veterans opportunity transfer characters soltech briggs dedicated thousands hours briggs basically kiss progress culmination design decisions behalf daybreak driven veterans away server population cases plus fails newer players incentive playing game add outdated soon updated hopefully graphics engine potentially game potential eventually dying chance fluorish

2304,13224,13228,Fallout Shelter,"I read a lot of complaints about this game, that make little to no sense if you ask me.People complain about micro payments, you dont need to buy anything, the wasteland and quests provide for everything you want to find/own, so paying for things, is optional.Others claim this game forces you to come back every 5 minutes because of the resource gather system, this too isnt correct thinking, when you are not in the game, the power/water/food supply, does not drop under the minimum required amount of said goods. So, your dwellers wont starve if you have not played for 2 days, it would not make sense if it was the case now, would it?And yet others complain that their dwellers die of lack of water or food, and that too is ridiculous, just make sure you got enough dwellers working the cafeteria(s), water refineree(s) and most importantly, the generator rooms, without power, other important rooms may stop functioning, and you can run out of water/food that way. Also, make sure you add dwellers to jobs, that they are meant for, look at a dweller's stats before you assign him or her to a room, for example, if you have a dweller with 1 S(trenght) and 4 P(erception), you dont want that dweller to work in the generator rooms because those demand S(trenght) so instead, you send that dweller to the water refinery because that room demands P(erception), the higher the skill level of a dweller, the better he or she is suited for tasks that demand those skills, it speeds up the process of said rooms.Ok review time, is this an amazing game? hmm, i guess that would be pushing it, but it sure is a fun game, looks good, has a million references to current and previous fallout games, with patience you can get all those items and dwellers from grinding the game itself, no cash needed.Unlike what some people try to claim, this game is perfect for casual play, but also for constant play.Questing is fun to do, exploring yields a lot of nice goodies as well, especially the longer you let a dweller explore the wastelands, the trick to do this succesfully is to make sure they go out there with a high damage weapon, and at least 25 stimpacks + say 10 or so, radaway, get them an outfit that gives them a bonus on strenght, perception, endurance and/or luck (there are a great variety of outfits, some with 1 added bonus, others with 2 or more) and also make sure the dweller you send, has decent levels of these skills, then you're set, and can send a dweller out for days at a time (actual days).Do keep in mind, that whenever there is a fight (raiders invading, radroaches, molrats, gouls, deathclaws) that you dont need to do the fighting yourself, the dwellers will do this (if they have weapons) but you will have to apply stimpacks and radaway to keep the dwellers alive during a fight (same in quests), an icon will appear above the dweller when low on health, click it and he/she will use a stimpack or radaway, just make sure they have good weapons and gear.But all in all, this game demands patience, and some people dont like to wait, thats 80% of the negative reactions on here i guess ;)enjoy the game, its free you know hehehe  (and not made by amateurs)",1, read lot complaints game little sense ask people complain micro payments nt need buy wasteland quests provide want find paying things optional claim game forces come minutes resource gather system nt correct thinking game power water food supply drop minimum required said goods dwellers wo nt starve played days sense case complain dwellers die lack water food ridiculous sure got dwellers working water importantly generator rooms power important rooms stop functioning run water food way sure add dwellers jobs meant look dweller stats assign room example dweller nt want dweller work generator rooms demand instead send dweller water refinery room demands higher skill level dweller better suited tasks demand skills speeds process said rooms ok review time amazing game hmm guess pushing sure fun game looks good million references current previous fallout games patience items dwellers grinding game cash needed unlike people try claim game perfect casual play constant play questing fun exploring yields lot nice goodies especially longer let dweller explore wastelands trick succesfully sure high damage weapon stimpacks radaway outfit gives bonus strenght perception endurance luck great variety outfits added bonus sure dweller send decent levels skills set send dweller days time actual mind fight raiders invading radroaches molrats gouls deathclaws nt need fighting dwellers weapons apply stimpacks radaway dwellers alive fight quests icon appear dweller low health click use stimpack radaway sure good weapons gear game demands patience people nt like wait s negative reactions guess enjoy game free know hehehe amateurs

Joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. Some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you.

2311,11354,11358,Black Squad,"Early Access ReviewPlayed the heck out of this game in closed beta and I totally loved it.This game is a lovely refresher to the modern FPS genre. Black Squad takes firing mechanics similar to the Counter-Strike series, alongside weapons that function similar to that of Call of Duty and Battlefield. The maps layouts are believable and play out very well. The guns feel good (though some are tricky to master), and each have their own specific playstyles. The gamemodes are fun, the maps work out pretty well. The graphics are pleasing and the animations are smooth and clean. So far the game seems promising. There doesn't seem to be any pay-to-win elements to Black Squad whatsoever. Sure, there's paid content, but it's only for cosmetic skins and character playermodels. However, I am not impressed with the crate system. I paid $0.99 (which is a good amount, to be fair) for a crate which contains the chance to get a weapon skin, in-game rare currency or standard currency. It's absurd that $0.99 gives you the chance to get standard currency which you can literally earn in one match. The standard currency should not be an available reward in paid crates whatsoever.In summary, Black Squad is a fun game and is very unique. Best played with friends.",1, early access reviewplayed heck game closed beta totally loved game lovely refresher modern fps genre black squad takes firing mechanics similar counter strike series alongside weapons function similar duty battlefield maps layouts believable play guns feel good tricky master specific playstyles gamemodes fun maps work pretty graphics pleasing animations smooth clean far game promising pay win elements black squad whatsoever sure paid content cosmetic skins character playermodels impressed crate system paid good fair crate contains chance weapon skin game rare currency standard currency absurd gives chance standard currency literally earn match standard currency available reward paid crates whatsoever summary black squad fun game unique best played friends

You can click on any place on the girl. There's no difference in the results. With the coins, you can buy more levels and allies. The allies fight for you automatically. The higher levels and improved allies allow you to keep winning without having to wait forever for the enemy hitpoints to go to zero, as the later enemies have ever more hitpoints than the previous ones.

2323,9994,9998,Elsword,"Looking at the amount of hours (plus several hundred more), you can tell that I clearly love this game. I would not invest so much of my time into a game I did not enjoy. There are so many characters, classes, skills, dungeons, and more to discover! By the time I have finished playing every single character, class, and gotten to the maximum level, I would no longer be a teenager.In a more serious note, there are obviously flaws to this game. All games do really. As for this, the main issue people have with this game is the balance between classes. It is understandable. I get it. Many classes are more overpowered than others. Just look at the recent renewals there have been lately. Old classes that were rarely seen before the renewal have been making a comeback because of their new skills, textures, stats, combos, etc.. However, the renewals are pretty cheap. Many of the renewed classes have skills that are constantly spammed. I would also like to include the recent balance patch made in KR. There has been A LOT of talk about it. It is one of the most impactful balance patches I believe.... Many of the overpowered characters are getting nerfed. That is interesting. It'll wreak havoc when the patch comes to NA in several months. PVP will be more balanced I hope.Yes, the current balances are quite an issue in PVP, but there is so much more to the game than that. Events, Henir, Secret Dungeons, Field, Raid Bosses.... There is so much more to do. Whether a player is stronger than another does not apply to those. You can still have fun. You can have fun exploring skills and combos and getting to know each individual class. You can have fun meeting the community (outside the salty Arena ofc) and make friends and join guilds.There is also the arguable fact about the phrase ""Pay to win."" Now, I do admit, I have spent A LOT in this game. That is only because I see myself playing this a lot, so I invest money into it. I do not pay to win. I more pay to make the experience of playing the game more enjoyable. Yeah, a skill B-Slot takes a big role in playing the game, but I feel like it could also be taken as a challenge. Not investing any money into a game is quite a challenge. I would admire anyone who could truly know the game without having to pay once. Luckily, Elsword has something called a board where you can not only sell craftable items and consumables, but you can sell items that come from the Item Mall where you could only use real money. On the board, people could use ED to buy those items, free of any real life charge.

2325,11327,11331,Eternal Card Game,"Everything about this game should be great, but they ruined it with a horrible resource requirement.  Much like MTG, there are cards like 'mana' resources which are dealt in your card draw.  It results in those games where you could be the best player in the world but lose to bad luck of drawing only resource cards every hand, or never drawing one at all and not being able to play your cards.  Why this is still a mechanic is baffling.  It's so flawed and other games have fixed it.   My suggestion is either deal two cards per turn and let players play one face down as a resource and lose it (adjust the deck characteristics, obviously.)  Or just do it turn based like some other similar games do.   Both of those options eliminate a great deck or player losing to bad luck.    MTG has had that problem and has been around for over 20 years, and it's always been a problem that people hate.  Why go back to that?   Other than that they are sitting on a truly great card game.    But it is like building the greatest boat in world and putting screen doors on the bottom of it.   It is painful to see something so close to greatness completely ruined by such a cringy face-palm of a decision like needing resource cards in your deck.  This game, besides that awful game-ruining mechanic is immediately obviously an easy 8/10 for deck battling card games.  But with that flawed mechanic, I, in my brief but perceptive opinion, am so disappointed at losing to bad luck without having a chance, it gets knocked down to a 2/10.

2336,10869,10873,Eternal Card Game,"Early Access ReviewLike many others, I came to Eternal from the RNG fiesta that is Hearthstone currently. This game is truly a breath of fresh air in today's digital CCG landscape.PROS:1. Although there are microtransactions, this game is truly F2P thanks to the generous rewards system. For example, in Draft Mode (like Arena in Hearthstone) you get to keep ALL 48 cards that you choose, on top of the usual rewards for winning. There are also free random cards and gold for ranked wins.2. Minimal RNG. However, because of the way the mana system works (similar to lands in MTG) you can get mana screwed but proper deck building should mitigate this,3. Interactive combat system. This is similar to MTG where you can take some actions (e.g. Fast Spells) on your opponent's turn, such as when he attacks you. Again, I compare this to Hearthstone where you pretty much can't do anything on your opponent's turn.4. Complex strategy. The cards in the first set are varied and allow for many different deck types. There are 5 factions and you can have all 5 in your deck (albeit risk getting mana screwed). 5. Complex tactics. Here I'm talking about the skill you need to assess the board state and make plays. Each player can have up to 14(?) units on the board and this can lead to deliciously challenging decisions - which units do I attack with and when? which  of my opponent's units do I block and with what units?CONS:1. Clunky UI. This is a minor gripe as it's already in a decent state, just needs a few tweaks.2. Small player base. This game isnt hugely popular now and there aren't alot of web resources (no net decks :(). Hopefully with the steam release this game will pick up in numbers.Overall this game is one of the better CCGs out there. And it's F2P, so there's really no reason not to install it and give it a go.",1, early access reviewlike came eternal rng fiesta hearthstone currently game truly breath fresh air today digital ccg landscape microtransactions game truly thanks generous rewards system example draft mode like arena hearthstone cards choose usual rewards winning free random cards gold ranked minimal rng way mana system works similar lands mtg mana screwed proper deck building mitigate interactive combat system similar mtg actions fast spells opponent turn attacks compare hearthstone pretty opponent complex strategy cards set varied allow different deck types factions deck albeit risk getting mana screwed complex tactics talking skill need assess board state plays player units board lead deliciously challenging decisions units attack opponent units block clunky ui minor gripe decent state needs small player base game nt hugely popular alot web resources net decks hopefully steam release game pick numbers overall game better ccgs reason install

2346,15795,15800,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewAlright, I know playing only 30 minutes worth of the game isn't exactly the best way to present my case, but there are things that are indeed kind of a gripe for me. Don't get me wrong, Adventure Quest was something of a lot of people's childhoods (Along with mine to a large extent) but the fact remains that there are some things that are kind of annoying.First off, there are WAY too many loading screens, seriously, if you thought Adventure Quest Worlds had a bad time with Loading screens... Oh boy, my friend, you're in for a shock. While it may be thanks to my bad internet, some of these loading screens can take thirty seconds to about two minutes. I don't get what was wrong with simply downloading the whole game, having the loading screens not require internet to go faster. (Yes I know the other games were like this, but it'd really save the hassle of sitting and waiting for the thing to load...)Now for the second, I think the dialog isn't all that bad, but the guardians seem... weak...I know that they're made to be protectors, but seriously, I've never seen guardians this weak since the days of the First Adventure Quest, I know this is looking into it a bit too much, but really? Getting their butts handed to them on a silver platter by a group of skeletons... At least in the first game, they actually did try to be somewhat strong, but still got defeated on a decent bases, I get that the main character (aka you) has always been the center of attention, but come on!Now for something good for once, I'm glad that they went back to the old Guardian system, where instead of paying a monthly fee, it's been reset back to the single payment it was back in the first game, which is a really neat thing. Sure there's still money that you need real dollars to by with, but thankfully guardian is one of those things that doesn't need a monthly payment. This is my two sense about it, I'll be honest, I'd be a bit harder on the game if it wasn't for the fact that it's been a part of most of my childhood. It's still a half decent game, and it's free for the most part, of course there's still all the microtransactions, but it's to be expected free games like this. I hope you enjoyed this review, even if it was a bit.. I don't know, half baked...

For a game funded off of kickstarter and in-app purchases, this game is quite good. Sure this game is a little grindy at times, but that can be part of the appeal. You don't have to grind to get to the end of the story, only if you want those extra bragging rights or a rare piece of gear, and once you get that item you've been waiting for, it's all the more rewarding. I'm heavily invested into the future of this game, having played and enjoyed both it and it's predecessors, and I hope to see a game that has progressed even further. My main criticism of this game is how hard some of the lower dungeons can be to solo. True, they aren't meant for soloing necessarily, but it does create a hurdle for the majority of people who want to get to the endgame content without any help because oftentimes, you have to wait awhile for others to show up in the dungeon and help.

2372,254,256,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,"Early Access Review*note* Pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indieDB and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). Now for the review.I'm not really a person who could judge what is considered ""cute"". i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you. So in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indieDB version i played). But outside of those ""enemies"", the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it's your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there's no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. What i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the ""rules"" to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what's in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie A) you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and B) that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.That's not to say that how the enemies appear in SPHJ is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don't know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it's own eeriness as you don't know what the next room holds for you. You have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.However this brings up an issue i have with the game, there's way too much luck involved. i'll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first ""catwalk"" room (that's what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). If you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.There are other points like this as there's an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i've yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven't encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you're going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i'm not sure if it's an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it's just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can't just hold down the W key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. No, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won't move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. Like i said i'm not sure if it's intentional or not, if it's not then i hope the devs will work on this as it's basically a cheap beginner's trap. But other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can't wait to see what the full release is like.",1, early access pay attention time got game indiedb got pretty far letting collect dust pursuing games fact got far worth proceeding version review person judge considered cute guess cardboard cutouts bit amusing said cutouts jump appear barely escaping enemy need follow path catch regard guess scary like devs stopped throwing cutout room like indiedb version played outside enemies actual enemies terrifying definitely heart racing time playing catch guard rhyme reason appearances mean unlike horror games good ones build enemies appearance occasions rules win said enemies laid example resident evil zombie encounter built sound effects create uneasy feeling knowing room following rules winning laid try fight zombie notice use ammo b damage avoiding notice things like faster agile zombies agile tank controls evasion preferred option enemies appear sphj bad fact opposite fact know encounter type enemy beat trying times new enemy adds eeriness know room holds constantly think fly adapt quicker brings issue game way luck involved good example enemy meet pretty easy figure run strategy bite rear come catwalk room room narrow walkways split multiple directions dead sprint chance taking wrong path getting cornered enemy takes hits points like enemy saw markipliers playthrough encounter appear random way figure wrong right case encountered red face enemy playthroughs like said game takes alot luck going far alot patience till lucky issue sure aesthetic choice encourage players calm game happened issue press forward time enter room mean hold w key moving soon enter room room release key press annoying aforementioned enemy forget wo damage till remember release forward key press like said sure intentional hope devs work basically cheap beginner trap issues think good horror game wait release like

2380,2009,2012,Path of Exile,"So currently I only have around 24 hours and I am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.Path of Exile is fantastic. EVERY steam owner should at one point or another try this game. However, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around 7 hours to get there (for me at least). This game is basically the paladins to diablo. Personally I think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.Art StyleIn act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. I personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. Thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act 3 being the nicest looking act thusfar. Diablo I think should be a keymark for this. Just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. Diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. PoE is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. ProgressionOk this is PURELY opinion based but I will try to be as objective as possible. Diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. In this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. In PoE it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. That being skills are merely ""items"" that you equip. This system allows for MUCH more creativity BUT can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. In MY personal opinion I think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. HOWEVERPoE wins in the costumazation department PURELY because of the passive skill tree. Holy crap. This skill tree. No barriers locked behind class walls. All classes can have any passive. That is SO. REFRESHING. Rarely ever do I see games do this and I still have no Idea why. GameplayThis is an Action RPG. Meaning prepare  yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. Not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. Overall This is a must play.

2387,4738,4742,SMITE®,"What a heart-wrenching review that I feel the necessity to write. My Steam hours are but a mere fraction of the actual amount of time I've invested into this game. I played long before Smite's steam client debut (and what an intial disaster that was).Over the course of time, I've played this game less, and less. I started playing around the time of Xbalanque release, I played on Pandorum eSports in Season 2 and then subsituted for AFK Gaming's Challenger Cup Team in Season 3. In short, I no longer have fun or enjoy this game. I have never been as frustrated or angry at a game as I ever have been with Smite. Hi-Rez has a very infamous streak of making amazing games, there isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that the games they make have nothing short of amazing potential. The fault lies when they stop listening to their fan base. Hi-Rez employees for the most part are overwhelmingly unprofessional, disrespectful, and have no moral compass when regarding their players, or their paying customers. Whilst I feel that the argument of ""I'm a paying customer, therefore I am always right and deserve respect"" is completely illogical, there comes a point where you are at least respectful enough to hear the complaints, constructive criticism, and voices of your fanbase. What's worse, is they don't listen to their professional players either. The players who have hundreds of hours if not thousands just simply theory crafting, crunching numbers, and taking their position very seriously, are completely disregarded in regards to balance. Their focus has been more streamlined in the direction of skins, adventure events, and things of the like, rather than balancing their game, and listening to no one but themselves. Matchmaking is nothing short of atrocious. You would imagine that a player with an upwards of 3,000 hours, would be matched against players of their same skill platform, instead, I am often paired with players with sub 1,000 hours, to even fresh accounts. My elo is in the top 5% of all players, and not only do I get paired with new players, but I get paired with toxic players who are self-proclaimed good players with less than a 50% win ratio. Now all of that aside, let's turn a blind eye to the disrespectful attitude of Hi-Rez employees, and the terrible matchmaking followed by a focus on aesthetic, useless content that holds no substance beyond distinguishing yourself with a unique skin. The bugs. The amount of bugs in this game are absolutely absurd. Fix one, create two more. This phrase can apply to nearly every patch to be released to date.The entire consensus of what I'm trying to say is, if you're considering playing this game, stay away. It is a horrible example of what a game should look like in terms of it's business structure and how it's handled. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself, and give it a week or so, and you'll see what I mean.",0, heart wrenching review feel necessity write steam hours mere fraction actual time invested game played long smite steam client debut intial disaster course time played game started playing time xbalanque release played pandorum esports season subsituted afk gaming challenger cup team season short longer fun enjoy game frustrated angry game smite hi rez infamous streak making amazing games shred doubt mind games short amazing potential fault lies stop listening fan base hi rez employees overwhelmingly unprofessional disrespectful moral compass players paying customers whilst feel argument paying customer right deserve respect completely illogical comes point respectful hear complaints constructive criticism voices fanbase worse listen professional players players hundreds hours thousands simply theory crafting crunching numbers taking position seriously completely disregarded regards balance focus streamlined direction skins adventure events things like balancing game listening matchmaking short atrocious imagine player upwards hours matched players skill platform instead paired players sub hours fresh accounts elo players paired new players paired toxic players self proclaimed good players win ratio aside let turn blind eye disrespectful attitude hi rez employees terrible matchmaking followed focus aesthetic useless content holds substance distinguishing unique skin bugs bugs game absolutely absurd fix create phrase apply nearly patch released date entire consensus trying considering playing game stay away horrible example game look like terms business structure handled believe try week mean

Kick off with an obvious one. Not keen on the mana system, leading to frustrating games with flood and screw. Yes one mana per turn systems have their own problems. I often don't seem to have many options of cards to play. Resulting from lack of good card draw and having to draw mana from deck? Games often end up with players top decking against each other. First to draw something good wins. Blocking vs direct attacking system is heralded as more complex therefore better. I agree it is slightly more complex as you have to think about all the possible permutations of your opponent blocking but I don’t think its better. Whilst it does make for slightly more technical thinking, they mostly aren’t interesting decisions to make and are usually just either correct or incorrect plays. It also leads to a lot of tedious stalemate boards. Again wait for a good top deck. The argument that the greater mechanical complexity of the game (e.g Instants, blocking, mana management etc... ) when compared to for example HS is a good thing I think is wrong. Again it doesn’t seem to lead to any more interesting decision making just for a more technical game.  Some strategies seem stupidly easy to play. I crafted a Tavrod Midrange deck that  required very minimal decision making and very easy to win with after only a few days experience.

2427,4401,4405,Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,Duel links is blast from the past. You play speed format meaning 3 zones to summon and spell/trap.

Like starting the duel with a field spell in play or getting polymerisation for your next draw if you take 1000 or more damage. So the strategy stems farther then just building a deck with your favorite character.The game is not pay to win like a lot of other users may clam as you can get gems to buy packs and decks pretty easy from normal play you can get more faster by paying but I haven’t spent more the $5 or $6 and I have most decks you can buy from the shop and I only been playing less than a month. One thing I really like is how you buy packs from the shop there’s a set number and a list of all the current cards you can get in the pack with a number telling how many are left you can get. This means if you really want a card from a pack just keep buying the same pack you will get it at some point because with every pack you buy your chances go up.The only issue I'm having right now are a few over powered cards and decks in this format. In the future I hope they start a ban list for ranked duels to force people to stop using copy paste decks they find on the internet.,1, duel links blast past play speed format meaning zones summon spell trap players like looking classic style games characters play voiced language want voice skills equip deck extra effects like starting duel field spell play getting polymerisation draw damage strategy stems farther building deck favorite character game pay win like lot users clam gems buy packs decks pretty easy normal play faster paying spent decks buy shop playing month thing like buy packs shop set number list current cards pack number telling left means want card pack buying pack point pack buy chances issue having right powered cards decks format future hope start ban list ranked duels force people stop copy paste decks find internet
2428,3656,3659,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2, a great game transformed over the years into a shape that I no longer recognise nor love. Having quit the game for around a year whilst still following updates, what I say may seem harsh but I say it because TF2 may still have the potential to be a great game again. In my opinion, TF2 has been neglected, lopsided balance and long-existing bugs left unaddressed for years. Whilst in recent months they have attempted to address such problems, they ultimately left them too late. Visually the game has changed a lot, mainly due to horrendous looking outlandish cosmetic items being added that didn't even try to match the original art style. Not forgetting the various visual changes that may be intentional or not, that have also decreased the quality of how the game appears. For example on older maps lighting is screwed up, as are several decorative decals found on those maps that are now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release. I don't want to list every issue like this as I understand they are likely this way due to either optimisation or updates to the Source engine over the years that have caused such parts of the game to break. The biggest nail in TF2's coffin for me was the removal of pubs in favour of an Overwatch-esque matchmaking system, completely changing how the majority would play. Drop in and drop out was one of the major appeals for me and it is one of the defining reasons I quit this game. The more casual atmosphere of pubs was enjoyable and the options for MvM and even competitive (TF2Center etc. not the terrible competitive they did add,) were there for those looking for a more coordinated experience. MvM was an enjoyable part of my playtime personally, however as mentioned earlier the lopsided balance of TF2 was only amplified here.

2430,8565,8569,Realm Royale,"Early Access ReviewIs it a Battle Royale? Yes. Do I have a lot of hours in it, and/or enjoy playing BR games incredibly often? No, not really. I liked PUBG at first, but the RNG nature of the genre very quickly grated on me, which persists even in this game.That won't stop me from praising it as a good game, though. My issues with it are a personal problem with the genre, and for an early Alpha stage game, it's incredibly well-done.I've been following it since its inception because I play SMITE, HiRez's other game, pretty extensively, and I like to know what other things the company is making. In the few months of closed Alpha testing prior to the release you see today, HiRez worked pretty closely with their community and the feedback they got. The biggest example is the class system: we almost didn't have that! The community wanted classes back above all else, after getting a taste of it in the Paladins Battlegrounds mode that they played with at HiRez Expo 2018.The way they've implemented classes and abilities is really unique for the Battle Royale genre, and it gives it a distinct RPG feel. There's a considerable skill ceiling with the ways you can use your movement abilities, and that's pretty cool.As it's currently an Alpha, expect there to be bugs, server connection issues, and gameplay imbalance. That's all to be expected, and frankly HiRez probably didn't expect there to be this many players (is it over 50k daily yet?) coming at once.tl;dr:-if you like BR games in general give it a shot, it's free anyway-if your least favorite part of Fortnite is building, you'll enjoy it-if you want to play as an RPG mage in a BR, you should like it",1, early access reviewis battle royale yes lot hours enjoy playing br games incredibly liked pubg rng nature genre quickly grated persists game wo stop praising good game issues personal problem genre early alpha stage game incredibly following inception play smite hirez game pretty extensively like know things company making months closed alpha testing prior release today hirez worked pretty closely community feedback got biggest example class system community wanted classes getting taste paladins battlegrounds mode played hirez expo way implemented classes abilities unique battle royale genre gives distinct rpg feel considerable skill ceiling ways use movement abilities pretty cool currently alpha expect bugs server connection issues gameplay imbalance expected frankly hirez probably expect players daily coming like br games general shot free favorite fortnite building enjoy want play rpg mage br like

2443,3617,3620,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2 is a fun game, and for better or for worse, it’s one that’s best experienced by putting a lot of time into it. There are hundreds of weapons that have different strengths, weaknesses, and special effects, which means that a dedicated player will find a lot of enjoyment in playing for a long time and trying to collect the best ones for their chosen classes. The colorful and humorous style of the game makes it a joy to watch and hear as you play, and the class-based system makes teamwork very important. All in all, it is a very well-made and enjoyable multiplayer shooter, and it’s completely free, making it a great choice for someone who wants to enjoy a video game with their friends. That said, it’s not the ideal game for someone who just wants to spend a few minutes every now and again; its expansive items and class system reward time, and if there’s not much time spent on it, it’s still fun, but not as rewarding. That said, that person shouldn’t be too young. The violence isn’t too much of a concern; it’s more graphic than most cartoon slaptstick, but not really any more offensive due to its cartoony nature. It’s just silly rather then being graphic or disturbing. But playing with real people over the internet simply requires enough maturity to understand and deal with the fact that people can sometimes be annoying or terrible, and though it’s not a dreadful community of people, it’s not without its bad apples. If your child is mature enough to handle the stuff classmates and internet communities tend to throw at them, there shouldn’t be a problem with this game. And if not, there’s always the option to turn off the blood and social elements of the game. In My Opinion:Team Fortress 2, in my opinion was the BEST game Valve ever made. The game gets updated every now and then and with each update, many things are changed are good and sometimes, bad. Weapons are updated with new statistics and lovable cosmetics are added. I really enjoy the diversity and variety of cosmetics each playable character has in the game. All I think Valve needs to do, is to just listen to the TF Community more often and value their opinions. In conclusion,I think that this is the BEST game I have ever played made from Valve and I highly recommend this game in future to other players as this is something everyone needs to try out once in their lives.",1, team fortress fun game better worse best experienced putting lot time hundreds weapons different strengths weaknesses special effects means dedicated player find lot enjoyment playing long time trying collect best ones chosen classes colorful humorous style game makes joy watch hear play class based system makes teamwork important enjoyable multiplayer shooter completely free making great choice wants enjoy video game friends said ideal game wants spend minutes expansive items class system reward time time spent fun rewarding said person young violence concern graphic cartoon slaptstick offensive cartoony nature silly graphic disturbing playing real people internet simply requires maturity understand deal fact people annoying terrible dreadful community people bad apples child mature handle stuff classmates internet communities tend throw problem game option turn blood social elements game opinion team fortress opinion best game valve game gets updated update things changed good bad weapons updated new statistics lovable cosmetics added enjoy diversity variety cosmetics playable character game think valve needs listen tf community value opinions conclusion think best game played valve highly recommend game future players needs try lives

2445,8202,8206,Neverwinter,"Oh where to begin with Neverwinter. Now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.Neverwinter is a f2p MMORPG Published by Perfect World. Now a lot of Perfect World games tend to be ""Pay to Win"" to the extreme. Neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. The only thing to win in Neverwinter is PVP, but PVP isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in PVP. Of course Neverwinter has an in-game currency called ""Zen"" that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing Zen lets you buy are ""Fashion Items"", dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. Now of course like many other MMOs, in game currencies like Zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. Mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. Is that Pay to Win? NO, it is not. What are you winning? A race to the quest area? People do not like spending real life money on MMOs, but the game is free is it not? So complaining is silly. Anways, the main currency in Neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called ""Astral Diamonds"". You don't want to spend real life money on Neverwinter? Have no fear, with AD you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. Though for a price. 25k AD is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a ""Purple"" item. Purple items sell for a fair amount of AD on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1Mill. So really, earning AD is not an issue. Me? I've played Neverwinter since Beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items I desired. I just played the game and earned AD, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. The point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. But many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. I also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the Zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade AD for Zen? Isn't that nice that Neverwinter allows you to do that? They give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. I don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a FREE game. In game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! Now lets talk about the workers behind Neverwinter that are really a great group of people. They constantly work hard daily to keep Neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. The employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. Its very important for a game to have that. They also play Neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. How cool is that? They also Stream on Twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like T-Shirts. So overall, Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMOs out right now. There's a reason I've been playing this game since beta. It even has an epic story line unlike many other MMOs that don't. Like everybody else, I skip dialog, I don't care, I just want to play. With Neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. Neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. Don't believe me? Check out my screenshots and look at my Neverwinter ones. You'll also see that I have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning AD.Like MMORPGs? Want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? Do you like Dungeons and Dragons?

2447,2660,2663,War Thunder,"This game is pretty decent, until you reach the ""cool"" and fun high-tier vehicles.If you love grinding and wasting money, this is the game for you. It takes a really long time unlocking new vehicles at the top tiers, and don't be surprised if you're losing Silver Lions (in-game currency, SL for short) while doing so. The research and money rewards are just way too low. Add to that the fact that you have to upgrade modules of each vehicle, and some of those modules are essential for even playing the game, and not having the upgrades is known as the stock syndrome. There's been a lot controversy lately regarding those module upgrades, since the Spare Parts and Fire Protection Equipment (FPE) modules have to be researched, and researching them on top tier tanks may take 30 games each, while also losing SL. Tanks are virtually useless without these upgrades, if you're hit, you're out. Not having other modules such as ammo types and engine upgrades can be compensated by having skill (aiming for weakspots, driving more cautiously), the lack of Spare Parts and FPE cannot. (The introducation of huge maps make it so that it's hard to know where the enemies are so you can get shot from anywhere.) Thus many players spend real money on Golden Eagles (GE, in-game currency) to get these modules and to regain the lost SL, or they simply quit the game out of frustation.Until they fix the research and SL gains/requirements and remove/change the Parts and FPE system, don't get into this game.Here are some videos and forum threads if you want to know more about the controversy:https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/9jdrog/rwarthunder_fpeparts_megathread/https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/427247-the-great-fpeparts-discussion-thread/&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4yr59jm2WQhttps://youtu.be/Z_YZ8An-A5ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQlvd-RANI (Controversial video from the devs)",0, game pretty decent reach cool fun high tier vehicles love grinding wasting money game takes long time unlocking new vehicles tiers surprised losing silver lions game currency sl short research money rewards way low add fact upgrade modules vehicle modules essential playing game having upgrades known stock syndrome lot controversy lately module upgrades spare parts fire protection equipment fpe modules researched researching tier tanks games losing sl tanks virtually useless upgrades hit having modules ammo types engine upgrades compensated having skill aiming weakspots driving cautiously lack spare parts fpe introducation huge maps hard know enemies shot players spend real money golden eagles ge game currency modules regain lost sl simply quit game frustation fix research sl gains requirements remove change parts fpe system game videos forum threads want know controversy r warthunder great fpeparts discussion rani controversial video devs

2459,16056,16061,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access Review*SEE AN UPDATE (DEC 21ST) BELOW*-January 23rd""After playing in EARLY ACCESS.""At the moment, this game does not feel like AQW in 3D.It doesn't have the charm that the browser game has. And I have played that sucker for 8 years.I'm not a game developer so it's ignorant for me to say this, but can't they just copy functions from AQW?For example the inventory screen. Why doesn't it have item categories like in AQW?I have also played this on mobile and I can say that this should be in my opinion a mobile only.It just isn't good enough for PC. The controls for example feel horrible.I had high hopes for this project when I pledged in Kickstarter but now, I don't know what to think.And I know that this is an Early Access game but it has been that way for some tme. And their description says that they were planning the LIVE release for winter of 2016. Unless that's a way to say that the Early Access goes live for everyone, I'm starting to fear that this will become another ""Perma-early access"" game.-July 25thThe game has surely gotten better.-Leveling process has gotten a lot more smoother.-Categories have been added into the inventory.-A ton of new content has been added.-An actual release date has been given.-The dungeons and the world overall are much more balanced. Which makes the gameplay fun, unlike before, when enemies dealt WAY too much damage.-December 21stSooo... Release dates mean nothing these days. Starting to think that this is going to be another Perma-early access once again. Some of the kickstarter rewards haven't been handed out yet. I also relized that the points I made earlier are not enough to make anyone recommend this game to anyone. We get these releases every now and then, that don't have anything to do with the features that were promised. Remember item fusion? I do. It doesn't exist. Pets, don't exist. Sidekicking, doesn't exist. New classes, don't exist. (Except the one that is coming out on PTR) I personally don't want this seasonal BS before the core game is ready. And it is not. Which infuriates me. I payed 60 euros for this in kickstarter. BOY do I regret it. And since AQW became absolutely TERRIBLE after 13 Lords of Chaos, my only safe haven is DragonFable. DON'T YOU DARE TO RUIN THAT ONE TOO AE!!! LEAVE TOMIX AND HIS TEAM ALONE!!! LET THEM CREATE AN ACTUALLY GOOD AND INTERESTING STORY AND WORLD!!! Not that you have done anything to it, YET! AQ3D has made me almost hate the company that I used to love. A LOT! BUT OH BOY!! It's all almost hate these days. I DO NOT recommend this game. Don't buy the DCs, don't buy anything related to this game. Make them finish the features that were promised FIRST! Don't let them release these seasonal money grabs and let them think that we don't remember the things that were promisd to us. Oh, and did you know they receives OVER 400K to develop this game... I'm offically done with this game, and will not be returning before it is the game that was advertised to us on Kickstarter. It's been 2 YEARS! 2 WHOLE YEARS!!! SAYING THAT MY AND THE COMMUNITY'S PATIENCE HAS RAN OUT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! Do not waste your money OR time on this game or company. Make the developers actually improve their practises before you start investing in them. AQ3D has been the worst investment I have done in my life. And it will most likely stay that way until people smarten up and let this game die away, like it should at this moment.In short, congratulations AE.

(outdated as of 30/06/2016)-Some of the game modes feel rather unbalanced-Medics determine the out come of matches a little too heavily (outdated)-Game balance seams to change faster than you can adapt your design at times-Premium account needed inorder to make rapid progress-Requires comitment to feel fun, do to frequent game changesSummary:This is a good game, don't get me wrong.

2464,5419,5423,World of Tanks Blitz,"Many people who struggle to understand the core concepts of this game would be inclined to tell you that it's pay to win (to of course diminish the fact that their profound lack of skill is not due to a lack of will or endeavor but that it is impossible to succeed in this game) but this is untrue. The very things that they complain about and term ""pay to win"" are accessible to everyone from the very beginning of the game, provided you allocate your earnings correctly and understand how the game works. The learning curve is quite steep, so this is probably the reason for many quitting and terming this a P2W; the only thing that can be bought for real money that one could term ""necessary"" is the premium system, wherein you earn 50% additional credits and experience (the primary tools of progression) so long as it is activated. This provides absoultely no in-game assistance, but is merely a convienence tool to boost progression (I myself use it as a full time student also working full time with generally only 5 or so hours a week to play the game). Any other core content can be earned. If the childish playerbase took the time to learn the game, understand the fundaental mechanics, they would see the fruit of the game design and enjoy it: the primary antithesis of this is the same as all multiplayer games - the community is short tempered and have a severe misunderstanding of the game. If this game piques your interest, certainly try and learn more before hopping into play, it will give you a significant advantage over those who chose to remain in ignorance out of self pity and lack of responsibility.",1, people struggle understand core concepts game inclined tell pay win course diminish fact profound lack skill lack endeavor impossible succeed game untrue things complain term pay win accessible beginning game provided allocate earnings correctly understand game works learning curve steep probably reason quitting terming thing bought real money term necessary premium system earn additional credits experience primary tools progression long activated provides absoultely game assistance merely convienence tool boost progression use time student working time generally hours week play game core content earned childish playerbase took time learn game understand fundaental mechanics fruit game design enjoy primary antithesis multiplayer games community short tempered severe misunderstanding game game piques interest certainly try learn hopping play significant advantage chose remain ignorance self pity lack responsibility

The story is interesting the gameplay is fun the graphics are smooth and the setting is just great. There are not many things I have found fault in with neverwinter but some of these are as follows, for an mmo neverwinter feels extremely linear with one quest linking to the next all the way to endgame. Another thing I dont like is endgame, I always get bored but this seems to just be the mmo way atm, there content creator helps somewhat in that user generated content can be pretty great, but it does not completely make up for some of the default content lacking that spark that makes it interesting. Even another thing that rubs me the wrong way is pvp, when the game was a newer release there seemed to be a more active pvp scene but now all the matches seem to me unbalanced and boring. Now dont think for a second I am going to end the recommendation on a sour note, I had a LOT of fun with the game on all my characters up until the point you start to feel that inevitable mmo fatigue. I recommend you try the game yourself to see if you like it or not, yea end game can be grindy, yea there are some ridiculous cash shop items but are these not things we have all come to expect from a free to play mmo?

2480,17200,17205,School of Dragons,"Believe it or not, I've actually been enjoying this game.NOW HEAR ME OUT!Maybe it's because I love the HTTYD franchise, maybe it's because I love having my own dragon to raise, maybe it's because puberty treated Hiccup well. However, I found the game to be colourful and frankly a breath of fresh air. The graphics are outdated and similar to PS2 graphics, it's glitchy, and I've lost my dragon several times just walking around. However, this game had many more glitches before I started playing it apparently, considering I was able to input my appropriate age and I only crashed once. What we must keep in mind is this game just came out yesterday. Understandably, who would want to put a glitchy, unfinished product on the market? *cough* Ubisoft *cough* But that's the beauty of MMO's, although sometimes glitchy at first, they develop and grow over time with the right support. I think this game has a lot of potential and I'm willing to stick around for it. The cutscenes are nothing to ogle at and they play scenes from the movies for some of the quests I've done so far. Call me blinded by nostalgia, but throwing movie scenes into a computer game takes me back to the old Disney PC games. Of course, it shows laziness on development's part by not creating these cutscenes themselves, but I can still appreciate putting scenes in from the movie. tl;dr version: I like this game. While it has it's flaws I think it has potential. 10/10 would have toothless follow my cursor in the lab again.",1, believe actually enjoying game hear love httyd franchise maybe love having dragon raise maybe puberty treated hiccup found game colourful frankly breath fresh air graphics outdated similar graphics glitchy lost dragon times walking game glitches started playing apparently considering able input appropriate age crashed mind game came yesterday understandably want glitchy unfinished product market cough ubisoft cough beauty mmo glitchy develop grow time right support think game lot potential willing stick cutscenes ogle play scenes movies quests far blinded nostalgia throwing movie scenes computer game takes old disney pc games course shows laziness development creating cutscenes appreciate putting scenes movie version like game flaws think potential toothless follow cursor lab

Well, it's not. Here's why:Minecraft is a voxel-based game, and so is Creativerse. However, many of the core elements between Creativerse and Minecraft are completely different and irrelevant to each other. If this game featured pickaxes, and mobs such as skeletons and zombies, then you can say it is trying to copy Minecraft, but it doesn't.An example of a minecraft clone would be minetest. That is clearly a minecraft clone. Both games vary in play-style, even when they're both based on the same concept!Comparing Minecraft to Creativerse is like comparing apples an oranges (classic example). Stop calling it a Minecraft clone, morons. The Review Creativerse is a voxel-based survival game, with good lighting, animation, water effects, as well as toon graphics. Every new player that first looks at this game judges immediately that this game is similar to Minecraft, and it is (note the difference between CLONE and SIMILAR). The game is fully online, and as such, nothing is stored in your computer. As you first enter this game, you will be immediately assigned a world that is stored online and not in your computer. What is lovely is that you can allow other players to join your world, and you can also join other people's worlds.I am going to review the UI, play-style and some elements of the game I found intriguing. Note that I just started playing this game, and already I am starting to see how wrong I was when I first made that terrible review.User InterfaceThe user-interface is pretty. Compared to many games, the developers put some effort into making everything pretty and nice to look at. Everything is well organized.Crafting interface is neat, and the crafting system is simple, but it can be easy to get lost in. Thankfully, there is a search option.Play-StylePlay-style of the game is unique. Each player starts with a touchstone that could be used to teleport an infinite amount of times, and other players can also teleport to them.Rather than use your traditional crafting table to create other items, you need to craft a processor that processes your materials into other materials.Ore in this game require to be mined using a device called an ""ore extractor"", rather than use the mining device.When you run and stop, you don't stop immediately, you slightly slide forward.Combat is tough and tricky, even pigs attack you, and landing a hit without getting hurt is difficult, but possible. Elements of the game I liked BlueprintsI loved the blueprints! But what I didn't like is that only the developers can supply blueprints, but other players cannot. Hopefully in the future players would be able to share their own creations for others to build out of.",1, notepreviously written review game severely negative based negative reviews bother playing game unable connect world turned problem isp use vpn able play game spammed connection timed deal people stating shop annoying happened additionally game pay win far seen makes win new game review definitely going updated near future creativerse minecraftlet clear thing people compare game minecraft think game clone minecraft voxel based game creativerse core elements creativerse minecraft completely different irrelevant game featured pickaxes mobs skeletons zombies trying copy minecraft example minecraft clone minetest clearly minecraft clone games vary play style based minecraft creativerse like comparing apples oranges classic example stop calling minecraft clone morons review creativerse voxel based survival game good lighting animation water effects toon graphics new player looks game judges immediately game similar minecraft note difference clone similar game fully online stored computer enter game immediately assigned world stored online computer lovely allow players join world join people worlds going review ui play style elements game found intriguing note started playing game starting wrong terrible review user interfacethe user interface pretty compared games developers effort making pretty nice look organized crafting interface neat crafting system simple easy lost thankfully search option play styleplay style game unique player starts touchstone teleport infinite times players teleport use traditional crafting table create items need craft processor processes materials materials ore game require mined device called ore extractor use mining device run stop stop immediately slightly slide forward combat tough tricky pigs attack landing hit getting hurt difficult possible elements game liked blueprintsi loved blueprints like developers supply blueprints players hopefully future players able share creations build

You can only hunt rabbit and one type of deer. But for this game the 40 euros for a year of licence is not bad and you get loads of stuff with it. And if you buy something with money like new guns and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumables. And just buy the types of guns to suit your hunting style and your fine. Also the ammo replenish after hunts so you only need a case or two. Because the yearly subscription fee is not that big and you get loads of stuff with it I think it is actually pretty fair. Just don't expect to do much without paying... And yes, if you like hunting and the game the developer fully deserve your money.

2539,2642,2645,War Thunder,"The good: game is marvelpiece from technical standpoint - beautiful graphics, good sound and all is well optimised. Tank and aircraft models are very detailed, there is considerable customisation as well. Plethora of vehicles, real and paper projects to toy with.The bad: balance isn't the best, with worst offender being top tiers, particularly jets. Aircraft gameplay resolves around destroying ground targets, so if you're up for fighter to fighter combat, you won't win many games. Tank gameplay is ""one shot"" in nature, as often single penetrating shell is enough to kill crew and/or detonate ammo racks, which leads to rather campy gameplay. Arcade mode with its respawn is both boon and curse - if one team collapses, it inevitably leads to spawnkilling. Realistic is aquired taste, unfortunately driving/flying for few minutes only to die in boom isn't exactly my flavor.The ugly: grind. On positive, you can research entire tech tree using only one vehicle. In theory, in practice its unlikely to happen before heat death of universe. Player progress is deliberately slowed down by need to research and buy at least 6 vehicles of current tier before progressing, which doesn't stop less competent players from playing more advanced toys. Obtaining your oh so expected new toy, be it tank or plane is only the beginning - after all you've bought junk of a vehicle and you need to upgrade it and with tanks (and upcoming warships) its especially bad. You can't repair your tank and you can't extinguish fires without researched Spare Parts and Fire Ex. While on low level vehicles its matter of few battles to get these, on top tiers it can take well over 50 battles to get anything, with hundreds of battles needed to unlock all upgrades.P2W - while there are no premium vehicles that are straight up overpowered (at least I'm not aware of them), there are plenty of options to gain advantage with open wallet. First - instantly buying upgrades for vehicles, its not so much P2W as its sanity saviour, especially on high tier vehicles. Second - crew. For gold eagles you can level up crew considerably, especially in ""sensitive"" aspects like vitality or reload speed. Third - increasing vehicle rooster. Free player can bring up to 5 vehicles into battle, paying player can bring 10. So should Arcade Air prove so hectic, paying player can in theory outlast non paying ones. Arcade Tanks are limited to 3 vehicles, so no issue there if one can prepare his/her lineups correctly.TL;DR if you can accept grind and/or limiting yourself to early vehicles and you're willing to learn basics (especially air combat), go for it.",0, good game marvelpiece technical standpoint beautiful graphics good sound optimised tank aircraft models detailed considerable customisation plethora vehicles real paper projects toy bad balance best worst offender tiers particularly jets aircraft gameplay resolves destroying ground targets fighter fighter combat wo win games tank gameplay shot nature single penetrating shell kill crew detonate ammo racks leads campy gameplay arcade mode respawn boon curse team collapses inevitably leads spawnkilling realistic aquired taste unfortunately driving flying minutes die boom exactly flavor ugly grind positive research entire tech tree vehicle theory practice unlikely happen heat death universe player progress deliberately slowed need research buy vehicles current tier progressing stop competent players playing advanced toys obtaining oh expected new toy tank plane beginning bought junk vehicle need upgrade tanks upcoming warships especially bad repair tank extinguish fires researched spare parts fire ex low level vehicles matter battles tiers battles hundreds battles needed unlock upgrades premium vehicles straight overpowered aware plenty options gain advantage open wallet instantly buying upgrades vehicles sanity saviour especially high tier vehicles second crew gold eagles level crew considerably especially sensitive aspects like vitality reload speed increasing vehicle rooster free player bring vehicles battle paying player bring arcade air prove hectic paying player theory outlast non paying ones arcade tanks limited vehicles issue prepare lineups correctly accept grind limiting early vehicles willing learn basics especially air combat

2546,2878,2881,War Thunder,"Came back after a year hiatus because there was a long list of issues I had with the game, everyone knows about the extraordinary long grinding time, which, fine its free to play, what more do you want? Wargaming's own research model isn't NEARLY as punitive for free to play players from how it feels. I don't play world of tanks, just warships, so I could be wrong on that factor 100%. Enough beating the horse. War Thunder's new matchmaking method still sucks. In fact I would go as far as to say it had gotten worse. It only seems to serve as a way to stack lower tiered players against higher tiered players (on both sides gotta get that two way action of frustration going) in order to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the lower tier players into coughing up cash to tier up only to find they get matched with vehicles of a still higher tier and the cycle only ends if you cough up that dosh to tier 5 where all you have to do is worry about players like myself that suffered up to the tier 5 grind. This seems to be more of a problem for armor than it does aviation where a bit more skill appears to be involved if you are outmatched against a better performing fighter. Unless you are prepared for the level of frustration that comes before you, its best to pick a game you will actually enjoy instead of grinding frustration simulator designed to try and coerce money out of your wallet.

With a wireshark scan you will find that the game has some type of program added to registry that sends data to an ip located in China. This ip is owned by tencent.

2573,4857,4861,SMITE®,"Supernovas happen because of when a sun is formed. it has a lot of gravity. This gravity pulls the matter(Mostly hydrogen) into the core of the sun where it undergoes extreme amounts of pressure and causes the Hydrogen to fuse. When the hydrogen fuses it turns into Helium and this fusion gives of a small amount of energy, but remember, there are billions of these fusions happening simultaneously, so that energy adds up real quick. When it releases energy, the particles have the energy to fight the intense gravity (which is why stars grow/don't immediately collapse). Now Helium is denser than Hydrogen, so it goes down father into the core and gets fused as well. The helium is fused into Oxygen and Carbon and emits even more energy for the matter to fight gravity and expand. but then there's a problem. when Carbon and Oxygen fuse into Iron, no energy is given off. This means that the star will started having an Iron core, but no problem because you still have some Hydrogen and Helium and stuff. But eventually all the Hydrogen will run out, leaving the denser Helium, Oxygen and Carbon to fight the intense Gravity. Then the helium goes and then Gravity starts to take its toll. The Star begins to shrink because the fusion of Oxygen and Carbon doesn't produce enough energy to fight gravity until eventually gravity packs the Oxygen, Carbon, and Iron closer and closer, without enough energy to fuse or fight back. Then the Gravity becomes way too much for the matter and the star implodes, ripping apart some of the Iron and Carbon and Oxygen back into their original Heliums and Hydrogens and creating a massive cloud of irradiated dust, ready to start the process all over again. And if the star is big enough(AKA has enough mass like a Blue Giant star) all the heavy elements in it keep of compressing pass the supernova point and becomes a singularity (some of the stuff does go supernova but most of it goes into the singularity)",1, supernovas happen sun formed lot gravity gravity pulls hydrogen core sun undergoes extreme amounts pressure causes hydrogen fuse hydrogen fuses turns helium fusion gives small energy remember billions fusions happening simultaneously energy adds real quick releases energy particles energy fight intense gravity stars grow immediately collapse helium denser hydrogen goes father core gets fused helium fused oxygen carbon emits energy matter fight gravity expand problem carbon oxygen fuse iron energy given means star started having iron core problem hydrogen helium stuff eventually hydrogen run leaving denser helium oxygen carbon fight intense gravity helium goes gravity starts toll star begins shrink fusion oxygen carbon produce energy fight gravity eventually gravity packs oxygen carbon iron closer closer energy fuse fight gravity way matter star implodes ripping apart iron carbon oxygen original heliums hydrogens creating massive cloud irradiated dust ready start process star big mass like blue giant star heavy elements compressing pass supernova point singularity stuff supernova goes singularity

2591,7207,7211,The Elder Scrolls®: Legends™,"This is nice game, great introduction for those first playing the genre. I've played 3 hours, a couple of matches a day following the story. Decks are quite well differentiated on how they are played. And matches are quick for those without much time. But as many other reviews I agree that gets repetitive quite quick.I mean, I can recommend this, but ultimately didn't like it. Games never last more than a couple of rounds, so you play with a few cards and there isn't many killer combos you can prepare or get chance to play to turn a match around. Mana or magica increases every round. And I didn't see so far a deck that allows you to increase yours or destroy your opponent pool, so there you lose a dregree of playability, and this ensures all cards are eventually playable, if you survive enough, If you have an 8 mana creature in the first hand, good luck with that.All are land creatures, and can always attack the oponent regardless how many defenses you have (except guards, those are well thougth). So, no much variety here, and there is not anything you trade off if you attack (you don't rotate cards), so, why not? The games reduces to the one who can make more damage per round, you can just ignore the enemy creatures if you hit strong enougthThis game is very casual, not thrilling at all.",1, nice game great introduction playing genre played hours couple matches day following story decks differentiated played matches quick time reviews agree gets repetitive quick mean recommend ultimately like games couple rounds play cards killer combos prepare chance play turn match mana magica increases round far deck allows increase destroy opponent pool lose dregree playability ensures cards eventually playable survive mana creature hand good luck land creatures attack oponent regardless defenses guards thougth variety trade attack rotate cards games reduces damage round ignore enemy creatures hit strong enougththis game casual thrilling

2616,15647,15652,AdventureQuest 3D,"Early Access ReviewWell.. I don't know what I expected, but I should have known better! I figured, hey, why not.. maybe there's something amusing to it.Loading screen tips are grammatically poor and engrishy for some reason. My hair is clipping and wigging out, models clip constantly, the dialogue is *beyond* ridiculous.. like, I get it, it's a lot easier to write obnoxious tongue-in-cheek meta dialog than actual dialog, but there's a line where it's twenty times worse than just the same ol' ""you're the great hero to save the world"" shtick. It also strikes me as ironic that they immediately take jabs at spending the first portion of gameplay wading through tutorials.. and then proceed to make you listen to an obnoxiously written little ""evil"" demon drone on and on and on as a tutorial.Visually it's decent if dated - I assume due to the cross platform aspect. Classes are stale as can be to begin - warrior/rogue/mage. Text is all WAY too big and makes the game look like it was intended for kids that need a high-chair to play. Horrible use of screen real-estate. The ""hotbar"" of sorts in the bottom right is far better, even if clearly mobile-y. Video options were mininal, and I found NO keyboard binding options, no mouselook settings, etc. So good luck if you want to change pretty much anything.As is, I cannot recommend it. I'll readily admit it's mostly personal taste - maybe you can look beyond the positively idiotic dialog and find something interesting in yet another mage that shoots a DoT fire/stun lightning and pretty much nothing else. Each class appears to just have four skills and I don't see any kind of progression within said class from the UI or game's explanation. The animations look decent enough and there's some spell effects and all, but everything is just a bit off sync, causing it to lose any and all ""oomph"" that it may have visually. Abilities feel far from impactful or fun to use and just kinda happen. Some of this may be early-stage latency and sync issues, but it's still an issue at present.After that I got stuck in a loop of server errors and dialog constantly repeating from the first character I spoke to despite trying to talk to others and do quests.Maybe down the line when they actually DO add a bunch of classes and make them more interesting and the server errors and such calm down it'd be worth a poke, but that's only if you can stand what looks like some pretty stale MMO-style play with very limited skillsets and minimal-to-no progression.. and you can overlook some especially horrid writing.

2620,10038,10042,Elsword,"Firstly, please don't let my hours fool you, I have many hours spread over various accounts.Elsword is a side-scrolling MMORPG. It has a 2.5D perspective that works suprisingly well with the game's design.It features beautiful backgrounds and some platforming elements. Even if you don't like platforming games, giveElsword a go, I hate platformers, but I love Elsword.COMBATIn Elsword, the combat is simple, but complex. You use Z and X along with the arrow keys to pull-off combos and you have 4 skills to use. A S D C. You can also buy a BSlot to get 4 more Q W E R. You use your combos and skills to kill monsters and bosses through fields (Open areas where you kill monsters along with other random players) and dungeons (instances where you team up with 3 other players to clear a dungeon area along with a boss at the end.)Now, If you are looking for an ultra-balanced MMORPG with competitive PvE and PvP, please leave. Elsword at its heartis more of a casual game. To contradict myself, it does also contain many competitive aspects, just don't expect them tobe balanced.But, please don't mistake this as me saying this game is bad and only for casuals. Elsword is very, very addicting and enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously. In order to enjoy this game, you will need to spend *SOME* money, but, contrary to what many people say, you don't honestly have to spend that much money. There are a few things that are more-or-less neccessary such as inventory expansions, but they are very cheap if you have any sort of income whatsoever. Other things such as Ice-Burners (Premium Costumes) (Costumes are cosmetic items that can be socketed in order to increase your stats) are not needed, thus you don't need to spend money on them, but they help.This is where my previous statement comes in. Elsword is a breath of fresh air if you don't treat it like WoW or LoL etc.. Its enviroments are light and airy, the music is nice and relaxing, and it's very fun to kick back and enjoy a few friendly arenas on a Friday night. What I would say to you is, try out the game, see if you enjoy the core combat and skill system and, if you do, play it. Don't worry about class balance, don't get angry, just relax and you'll love this game.Here's a list of things you'll NEED to enjoy the game if you really want to commit to Elsword. (Cost after the :.)Inventory Expansions:  Roughly $20 per character.Skill B Slot: $9 per character (But you can buy VIP, $10/month to get B slot on every character for duration of VIP).Bank Slots: $~9Overall, if you really want to commit to Elsword, buying VIP is a good way to kickstart your leveling and get some temporary BSlots (Btw, BSlots allow you to equip more skills.)If you have any more questions about the game, either message me on Steam, or add me on Elsword. My IGN is Vjyorsk. I'd be happy to help with anything you need. (As long as I'm not busy :)).

2622,3514,3517,Ring of Elysium,"Early Access ReviewPeople have been referring to this game as the free, and better, PUBG. Could this be true? Is it worth your precious 3 mins of download? Let's see... Core Gameplay It's....a battle royale game. I didn't expect much from it as I felt it was trying to copy other games just for that sweet popularity. I'm pretty impressed about how this game actually performed.You start off with a view of a map. You pick where you spawn, and you can see where others spawn. You have 3 classes, glider (you can jump and glide from high places) Snow Boarder (You can snow board fast down hills) and Climber (You can climb mountains and use the various zip lines placed throughout the map.There are an...okay variety of guns. It's not a lot, but it's pretty decent. I've encountered like 8 different guns. The loot spawns in predictable places, I think they're set to spawn there every time. Details The graphics are okay. I mean, there are particles of snow that pop up when you drive/run, and you can leave footsteps in a certain density of snow. Different textures have different sounds, and I'm shocked as of how realistic they sound.The gunfire has realistic recoil, and the guns are pretty detailed.The textures have 3 settings, low, medium, and standard. None of these really make a difference, however. Optimization Sadlly, this game is poorly optimized. The game stutters a lot and I encounter frame drops and rubber banding, even with an i7 and 1060ti and set to lowest settings. The game's ""minimum requirements"" are just basically what you must have to get to the main menu. Overall Well, the review can be summarized short and simple. The game is free, however it really exceeded my expectations for a free game. I can't really complain about the little things, the only real problem I have with this free game is it's poor optimization.Is it worth your time to download and play? I mean...yea. It's pretty fun, and it  pretty much is the free, better PUBG.
